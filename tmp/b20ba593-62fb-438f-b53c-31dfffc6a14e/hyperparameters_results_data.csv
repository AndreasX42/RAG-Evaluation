1,"The decrease in provisions and increase in liabilities can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the decrease in provisions may be due to a reduction in the estimated expenses or liabilities that the company had previously set aside funds for. This could be a result of improved risk management, lower anticipated costs, or successful resolution of certain obligations.

On the other hand, the increase in liabilities can be attributed to various factors. One significant factor is the increase in liabilities to affiliated companies, which rose by 3.6 million euros to 7.5 million euros. This suggests that the company has entered into new financial obligations or increased its existing liabilities with its affiliated companies.

Additionally, there was an increase in trade payables by 1.5 million euros. This indicates that the company has accumulated more unpaid invoices or outstanding debts to its suppliers or creditors.

Lastly, there was a decrease in other liabilities by 0.7 million euros to 2.6 million euros. This suggests that the company has either paid off some of its other liabilities or reclassified them into different categories.
