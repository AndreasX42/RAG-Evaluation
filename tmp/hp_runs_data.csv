1,"Some key developments in the insurance industry include the adoption of microservice-oriented architectures for rapid innovation and flexibility, the use of platforms and ecosystems to expand digital products and services, the acquisition of closed insurance contract portfolios for economies of scale, and the digitization of business processes for efficiency and cost reduction. Additionally, there is a focus on developing innovative insurance products that meet policyholders' needs for security, returns, and flexibility while complying with regulatory requirements.","///Retrieved document 0: Given the current challenges, microservice-oriented ar- chitectures designed to quickly support modified busi- ness models and high system versatility for the rapid in- troduction of innovative products are factors crucial to the success of insurance companies. The developments in insurance products described above are typically not associated with particular product families. The plat- form economy is also playing a key role in the insurance industry this year: numerous insurers are now using platforms and ecosystems to provide digital products and services beyond what had previously been their core business – this in turn is opening up new ways to create value.
For larger insurance companies, the acquisition of closed insurance contract portfolios that are no lon- ger available for sale (‘run-off’ portfolios) from mainly smaller insurance companies remains an important fac- tor. This enables the latter to generate positive effects for their books, and buyers can generate significant economies of scale and cost synergies. Modern asset management with modern and powerful IT systems plays a decisive role in this regard as well in the more efficient management of contracts.
The digitisation of our economy and society has been accelerated greatly by the Covid-19 pandemic and re- mains one of the most significant challenges facing the German insurance industry. Digitised business pro- cesses enable the ever-greater integration of systems across divisions, segments and company boundaries. That makes it possible to exploit the potential repre- sented by the standardisation and automation of pro- cesses to a greater extent. Fully automated processes lead to enormous gains with regard to efficiency as well as significantly lower costs. The subjects of customer centricity and individualisation, industrialisation and automation, analytics and data effectiveness, and stan- dardisation and integration are at the heart of the digi- tisation trend. Insurers are increasingly committed to cloud solutions with which IT capacities can be adapted to meet the level of demand in a flexible manner.
With digitisation, modern insurance products and ser- vices can be made available on new channels or inte- grated into new sales and cooperation platforms; all of this requires extensive changes to the IT landscapes of insurers in order for the new technology and platforms to be integrated and is taken into account by msg life when it develops its products and services. The compa- ny already has SaaS and cloud-based solutions to sup- port its customers with the digitisation process, thanks in no small part to its strategic collaboration with IBM.

Despite persistently difficult general conditions, private life insurance cover remains indispensable in Germany in view of the demographic trend and the necessity of covering against biometric risks. In the process, almost all insurers are striving to enhance their existing pro- duct ranges and develop new, innovative ones – this goes for all existing product groups, control layers and legal forms. The companies’ starting situations and the pressure on them to innovate vary and are consequent- ly bringing about a variety of innovations. The focus is on products that tick more than one box at the same time: products that satisfy the desire of the policyhold- ers for security, returns and flexibility, meet the needs of the insurer in terms of more efficiency and profitabil- ity and comply with the regulatory requirements at the same time.
In terms of the conventional capital accumulation pro- ducts, modifications of the guarantees are dominant, for example through the use of current calculation guidelines or by dispensing with the annual interest guarantee. With the biometric products, too, there is a great deal of action on the market. Dynamic hybrid products have become the standard now and there is a continuous flow of innovative products in addition to them which allow, for example, investment in funds, but also the purchasing of options on the basis of tra- ditional basic cover. Insurance companies at the larger end of the scale in particular are offering products for old-age provision with capital guarantees on the basis of unit-linked approaches with investment guarantees.

///Retrieved document 2: Likewise, insurers in the USA have survived the crisis rel- atively well. This is the conclusion of the article entitled ‘Der Versicherungsmarkt USA im Blick’ (‘A look at the US insurance market’) published by the R&D service pro- vider Versicherungsforen Leipzig in December 2021. It states that gross premiums grew by 0.6 per cent overall in 2020. Although growth of 1.2 per cent was achieved in the non-life segment, life premiums decreased by 1.4 per cent. With gross premiums of 2.5 billion dollars, the US insurance industry is a global market leader: the USA accounts for more than 40 per cent of the global market.
Development of business
In the German-speaking market, the msg life Group is the market leader with the services and products it of- fers for life insurers and pension fund institutions and more than half of all leading life insurers in these coun- tries are its customers. The Group’s research and devel- opment activities are aimed at continuously reinforcing its leading position. With the regulatory requirements still changing constantly and the increasingly dynamic variety of products, insurance companies are increas- ingly pursuing a strategy of replacing their previous in- house software solutions with standard software.
msg life’s products and consulting services are now a fixed part of the msg Group’s portfolio for the insurance industry. And as an associated company in the msg Group, msg life is an even more significant strategic partner for its customers and an even more attractive employer for the employees.
Insurers’ expenses on IT also reflect the relevance of digitisation: according to the GDV, the insurance in- dustry invested around 5.6 billion euros in its IT in the 2020 financial year, compared to around 5.5 billion eu- ros in 2019. At 2.55 per cent, the IT cost ratio (the ratio of IT expenses to companies’ gross premium income) remained almost constant. According to the GDV publi-

Artificial intelligence (AI) is also becoming increasingly relevant as a topic. The use of AI (and automated ma- chine learning at its heart) not only improves efficiency through automation, but also facilitates new technical approaches which in turn pave the way for entirely new business models, services and products. In connection with AI, insurers are also concentrating on robo-advis- ers, advanced analytics and blockchain.
For one, msg life is responding to this with the TRAIL.X project, where deep neural networks (DNNs) are being developed for the actuarial computation module in cooperation with the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. These DNNs will enable life insurers to replace old system generations, map their core functions with artificial intelligence and integrate them into a modern system.
Further development of products and services
msg life is pressing ahead with the further technical and functional optimisation and completion of its product range in the fields of life insurance and pensions. The necessary investments for this are being kept at a rela- tively normal level for a software company in the current year.

Trustworthy AI and au- tomated machine learning are two topics that play an important role in this context.
The project breaks new technological ground and will create a fundamentally new hybrid technology at the point where machine learning, software development and actuarial mathematics intersect. The work ties in closely with the work in an ongoing migration project for an msg life customer and will be subsidised for three years by the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs, Re- gional Development and Energy (StMWi).
Business with existing customers in 2021 was charac- terised by extremely stable, successful projects as well as a continuous flow of new contracts. The company ex- pects these developments to continue in 2022.
msg life was able to achieve sales successes in almost every region in which the company operated in 2021:
In the German-speaking market, the contracts for a proof of concept relating to the potential rollout of msg. Insurance Suite were signed with a well-known life in- surer and, shortly after the end of the reporting period, a start-up life insurer. Furthermore, the long-standing customer HUK-Coburg awarded contracts to roll out msg.RAN and msg.Tax Data. Likewise, the company was awarded contracts to roll out msg.Tax Data from Öffent- liche Versicherung Braunschweig and AXA Lebensver- sicherung AG. ERGO also placed an order to introduce msg.Life Product, the mathematical component of msg. Life Factory.
msg life is also cultivating the Benelux market inten- sively from the German-speaking countries. After gain- ing AEGON in the Netherlands as a customer in 2020, msg life is generating interest there with its range of products, especially from insurance groups which op- erate nationally.

The developments in insurance products described above are typically not associated with particular product families. The plat- form economy is also playing a key role in the insurance industry this year: numerous insurers are now using platforms and ecosystems to provide digital products and services beyond what had previously been their core business – this in turn is opening up new ways to create value.
For larger insurance companies, the acquisition of closed insurance contract portfolios that are no lon- ger available for sale (‘run-off’ portfolios) from mainly smaller insurance companies remains an important fac- tor. This enables the latter to generate positive effects for their books, and buyers can generate significant economies of scale and cost synergies. Modern asset management with modern and powerful IT systems plays a decisive role in this regard as well in the more efficient management of contracts.
The digitisation of our economy and society has been accelerated greatly by the Covid-19 pandemic and re- mains one of the most significant challenges facing the German insurance industry. Digitised business pro- cesses enable the ever-greater integration of systems across divisions, segments and company boundaries. That makes it possible to exploit the potential repre- sented by the standardisation and automation of pro- cesses to a greater extent. Fully automated processes lead to enormous gains with regard to efficiency as well as significantly lower costs. The subjects of customer centricity and individualisation, industrialisation and automation, analytics and data effectiveness, and stan- dardisation and integration are at the heart of the digi- tisation trend. Insurers are increasingly committed to cloud solutions with which IT capacities can be adapted to meet the level of demand in a flexible manner.
With digitisation, modern insurance products and ser- vices can be made available on new channels or inte- grated into new sales and cooperation platforms; all of this requires extensive changes to the IT landscapes of insurers in order for the new technology and platforms to be integrated and is taken into account by msg life when it develops its products and services. The compa- ny already has SaaS and cloud-based solutions to sup- port its customers with the digitisation process, thanks in no small part to its strategic collaboration with IBM.

///Retrieved document 2: Under the more difficult conditions of the Covid-19 pan- demic, the German insurance industry closed the 2021 financial year with a ‘solid’ performance, concludes Wolfgang Weiler, president of the Gesamtverband der Deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft (GDV), at its annual media conference in January 2022. He announced that insurers reported an increase in premiums of 1.1 per cent (previous year: 1.6 per cent) across all segments, reaching 223.4 billion euros.
The outlook for 2022 is cautiously optimistic. Accord- ing to the GDV, the industry expects premium growth of between 2 and 3 per cent. With regard to life insur- ance, the Covid-19 pandemic can be expected to have an impact on business prospects in the current year too. Premium growth of between 1 and 2 per cent could be considered realistic here. The GDV expects a weaker performance from traditional life insurance products, although market-oriented products are expected to grow more strongly. ‘The decisive factors here are the economic prospects of private households and the gen- eral political conditions for private old-age pensions in the current legislative period’, said Weiler.
The GDV goes on to report that the premium income of life insurers and pension funds amounted to around 102 billion euros in the financial year ended. That amount is 1.4 per cent lower than in 2020. Whereas current pre- mium income increased slightly to 65.3 billion euros, one-time premiums declined to 36.5 billion euros (-4.7 per cent).
According to the GDV, new Riester business performed well with growth of 12 per cent to 310,500 contracts. The portfolio largely remained stable, with around 10.4 mil- lion contracts. With regard to basic pensions, the num- ber of newly brokered policies increased by almost 40 per cent to 119,000 contracts. This caused the overall portfolio to grow by 4 per cent to 2.5 million contracts.

Despite persistently difficult general conditions, private life insurance cover remains indispensable in Germany in view of the demographic trend and the necessity of covering against biometric risks. In the process, almost all insurers are striving to enhance their existing pro- duct ranges and develop new, innovative ones – this goes for all existing product groups, control layers and legal forms. The companies’ starting situations and the pressure on them to innovate vary and are consequent- ly bringing about a variety of innovations.

///Retrieved document 1: Likewise, insurers in the USA have survived the crisis rel- atively well. This is the conclusion of the article entitled ‘Der Versicherungsmarkt USA im Blick’ (‘A look at the US insurance market’) published by the R&D service pro- vider Versicherungsforen Leipzig in December 2021. It states that gross premiums grew by 0.6 per cent overall in 2020. Although growth of 1.2 per cent was achieved in the non-life segment, life premiums decreased by 1.4 per cent. With gross premiums of 2.5 billion dollars, the US insurance industry is a global market leader: the USA accounts for more than 40 per cent of the global market.
Development of business
In the German-speaking market, the msg life Group is the market leader with the services and products it of- fers for life insurers and pension fund institutions and more than half of all leading life insurers in these coun- tries are its customers. The Group’s research and devel- opment activities are aimed at continuously reinforcing its leading position. With the regulatory requirements still changing constantly and the increasingly dynamic variety of products, insurance companies are increas- ingly pursuing a strategy of replacing their previous in- house software solutions with standard software.
msg life’s products and consulting services are now a fixed part of the msg Group’s portfolio for the insurance industry. And as an associated company in the msg Group, msg life is an even more significant strategic partner for its customers and an even more attractive employer for the employees.
Insurers’ expenses on IT also reflect the relevance of digitisation: according to the GDV, the insurance in- dustry invested around 5.6 billion euros in its IT in the 2020 financial year, compared to around 5.5 billion eu- ros in 2019. At 2.55 per cent, the IT cost ratio (the ratio of IT expenses to companies’ gross premium income) remained almost constant. According to the GDV publi-
In the TRAIL.X (TRustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Life Insurance) project that was launched in 2021, msg life and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich are de- veloping deep neural networks (DNNs) for the actuarial computation module.

In addition to the implementation and integration of specific software products, the range of services offered by msg life encompasses a variety of consulting services in connection with product and tar- iff modelling, for example, as well as operator models – these are generating growing interest in the market.
The target group of the msg life Group company there is predominantly health and group insurers and, in fu- ture, will also include life insurers on the basis of the US product portfolio. The expansion and diversification of the company’s own range of solutions and partner- ships with specialised service providers are being used to unlock new customer groups. Now that the Biden ad- ministration has built on the Patient Protection and Af- fordable Care Act, msg life expects the state healthcare programmes such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid to grow further with the sales opportu- nities this provides. In the US market, msg life is also examining the potential for a commercial partnership in the field of health insurance.
Following an excellent 2021 financial year, msg life is registering a high level of demand for solutions in the first quarter of the current 2022 financial year – from insurance companies in Germany and other countries in equal measure. In this context, msg life also expects to see further regulation throughout the financial ser- vices sector. Be it the revision of Solvency II, the new international accounting standard IFRS 17, the Europe- an Transparency Directive, the rollout of a digital pen- sion overview or the introduction of PEPP, the ongoing implementation of numerous regulatory requirements necessitates comprehensive changes to the solutions which are currently used and ties up vast amounts of insurers’ resources. This means that the use of versatile, cost-effective standard software remains highly attrac- tive throughout the insurance industry.

The Group’s foundations
Business model
Since 1980, the msg life Group has been developing IT system solutions, advising customers on how to im- plement their IT strategies successfully and has devel- oped into a leading provider of software, advice and digital cloud solutions for life insurance companies and pension fund institutions in Europe and, in particular, health insurance companies in the United States. In addition to enjoying a leading market position in the German-speaking countries, msg life’s software is de- ployed worldwide. The solutions of the company are being used in over 30 countries.

The goal is to increase the competitiveness of international insurance companies by offering a fully digitized end-to-end solution. This partnership aims to secure the future of msg life and its customers.,"///Retrieved document 0: With more than 1,200 employees at sites in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Slovakia, Slove- nia, Portugal, Spain and the United States, msg life is very well positioned in the field of software and consult- ing services for insurance companies and pension fund institutions. msg life’s wide range of digitised products and services for life insurance companies in Europe and, in particular, health and group insurance companies in the United States, gives it excellent market opportuni- ties and a promising competitive position.
In connection with its ongoing internationalisation strategy, msg life and IBM have entered into a partner- ship to open up new insurance markets. The goal is to significantly increase the competitiveness of interna- tional insurance companies through a fully digitised end-to-end solution, thereby securing their future.
In the past, the strategic presence of msg life in each foreign market was an important success factor when it came to attracting new customers. It is also becoming more and more apparent that Group companies want to put the solutions implemented for one region at the disposal of other Group companies in other countries – which can advance the ongoing internationalisation of msg life as a service provider for its customers. Besides the established partnership with IBM, the objective in the 2022 financial year is to press ahead with ma- jor sales projects, especially in the established foreign markets, as in the 2021 financial year.
The Benelux countries are an important market in this regard, where msg life, in cooperation with IBM, gained its largest new customer so far in AEGON in the Nether- lands, and is now working on the related introductory project.
The Austrian market is also a cornerstone of msg life’s international activities: msg life has enjoyed a number of highly significant successes there in recent years. The placement and further development of the consulting portfolio for the German-language markets and the mar- keting of msg life products in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is carried out from Vienna. On the Swiss market, too, msg life sees good prospects for the further expansion of its business and is represent- ed with its own offices and by various well-known life insurers such as AXA and Schweizerische Mobiliar. An innovative, AI-based and previously unique migration solution developed by msg life will be used at AXA in 2023 in the context of the acquisition of the legacy port- folio.

1,Currency risk refers to the potential for the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument to fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates.,"///Retrieved document 0: For the most part, the operating companies of the Group carry out their business activities in their respective countries. The Group – with the exception of the United States – is therefore not exposed to any significant cur- rency risks in its operating business. A total of 90 per cent of its revenues are generated in eurozone countries (previous year: 87 per cent), and the remainder in Swit- zerland and the United States. The currency risk on the asset side in relation to trade receivables comes from receivables not denominated in euros, accounting for 15 per cent (previous year: 13 per cent). In the case of trade payables, currency risks occur in relation to the 3 per cent of liabilities not denominated in euros (previ- ous year: 5 per cent). Differences arising from currency conversion of financial statements from a foreign cur- rency to the Group currency for the creation of consol- idated financial statements do not affect currency risk because the respective changes in foreign currency are recognised under equity with no effect on income.
Market risks:
Market risks result from changes in market prices. These cause the fair values of financial instruments or future cash flows relating to them to fluctuate. Market risks encompass interest rate, currency and other price risks (such as commodity prices and share prices).
Price risks:
The msg life Group is not exposed to any price risks.
Information on risk concentration (concentration risks):
The company does not have any dependencies on the procurement side. On the sales side, there tend to be concentrations of risk due to the geographic distribu- tion of turnover. For example, Germany accounts for an 88.8 per cent share of turnover (previous year: 85.0 per cent).
Interest rate risks:
Interest rate risks result from a fluctuation in the fair val- ue or future cash flows of a financial instrument due to changes in market interest rates.
Within trade receivables, there is no significant con- centration on individual customers. In the year under review, the ten largest customers accounted for a 64.0 per cent share of turnover (previous year: 61.1 per cent) and a 33.7 per cent share of trade receivables (previous year: 37.9 per cent).

///Retrieved document 1: There are no significant default risks in relation to other financial assets.
Liquidity risks:
Managing liquidity risk includes ensuring that the com- pany always has sufficient liquid funds or credit lines available to enable it to meet its payment obligations and hedge against risks resulting from fluctuations in payment flows. Among other things, the payment ob- ligations consist of interest and redemption payments. Liquidity risk also includes the risk of not being able to obtain sufficient liquidity at the expected terms when required (refinancing risk).
Under the management mechanisms now in place, the daily holdings of cash and cash equivalents and the monthly rolling financial plans are monitored by the company’s management. The purpose of liquidity man- agement is to finance predictable deficits at standard market terms under normal market conditions. This

means that losses from both borrowing capital at exces- sive interest rates as well as investing surplus funds at interest rates below the market level should be avoided.
Because of the company’s large holdings of cash and cash equivalents, the msg life Group considers the li- quidity risk to be low at present. The msg life Group has sufficient liquid funds to enable it to service its financial liabilities.
In addition, as at the reporting date, there are cred- it lines with banks amounting to 7.5 million euros, of which 1.560 million euros had been used at the report- ing date for security deposits.
In the 2021 financial year and in the previous year, no income from debt waivers was realised.

///Retrieved document 2: The income and operating cash flows of the Group are not, on the whole, exposed to any interest rate risk. There are no significant interest rate risks in relation to its financial assets. The investment of cash and cash equivalents is done on a short-term basis and under- goes the normal market fluctuations. On the condition that all other parameters remained unchanged, the company assumes that interest rates were ten base points lower (higher) in the reporting period. In this case, the net result for 2021 would have been 8,000 euros lower (higher) (previous year: 8,000 euros lower (higher)) and the equity components would have been 8,000 euros lower (higher) (previous year: 8,000 euros lower (higher)).
In the reporting period as well as the previous year, there were no (interest-bearing) financial liabilities with variable interest rates.
Currency risks:
Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in exchange rates.
With regard to cash and cash equivalents, there is no concentration on individual institutions.
Overall assessment of the opportunities and risks
msg life believes that, in light of the likelihood of their occurrence and their effects, the risks described above do not represent a threat to the company’s continued existence either individually or as a whole. Senior man- agement remains confident that the Group’s earning power constitutes a solid basis for the future develop- ment of its business and will generate the resources that will be necessary for the Group to pursue the op- portunities that present themselves. In view of its lead- ing position on the market, its functional and techno- logical innovative power, its committed employees and its processes for the early identification of risks, msg life is confident that, in 2022, it will again be able to deal successfully with the challenges that arise from the aforementioned risks.

These risks include the potential for projects to exceed budget or fail to meet specifications, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on employees and customer projects, software defects that could damage the Group's reputation, currency risks, concentration risks in sales, and liquidity, currency, default, and interest rate risks associated with financial instruments.","///Retrieved document 0: Project and product risks
The main potential source of risk in the course of op- erating activity lies in the calculation of the complex projects and in their organisational, functional, techni- cal and commercial handling. These risks are controlled and monitored by means of the valid Group-wide stan- dards for project and project risk management. The risk nevertheless remains that projects cannot be realised profitably for the msg life Group because costs exceed the agreed budget, deadlines cannot be met or the ser- vices rendered fail to comply with the agreed functional specifications or the required quality, and the msg life Group will therefore have to grant a discount or pay com- pensation. The overall risk profile of all ongoing projects was further reduced in 2021. The existing risks of indi- vidual projects have been appropriately taken into ac- count for 2022. The cumulative occurrence in multiple projects could, however, lead to negative effects.
In the 2021 financial year, particular attention was paid to the potential impact of the current Covid-19 pan- demic on the company.

Problems in the execution of projects and software defects that can occur in the operation of software produced by msg life can do last- ing damage to the reputation of the msg life Group and thereby have a substantial impact on the future course of business.

///Retrieved document 1: For the most part, the operating companies of the Group carry out their business activities in their respective countries. The Group – with the exception of the United States – is therefore not exposed to any significant cur- rency risks in its operating business. A total of 90 per cent of its revenues are generated in eurozone countries (previous year: 87 per cent), and the remainder in Swit- zerland and the United States. The currency risk on the asset side in relation to trade receivables comes from receivables not denominated in euros, accounting for 15 per cent (previous year: 13 per cent). In the case of trade payables, currency risks occur in relation to the 3 per cent of liabilities not denominated in euros (previ- ous year: 5 per cent). Differences arising from currency conversion of financial statements from a foreign cur- rency to the Group currency for the creation of consol- idated financial statements do not affect currency risk because the respective changes in foreign currency are recognised under equity with no effect on income.
Market risks:
Market risks result from changes in market prices. These cause the fair values of financial instruments or future cash flows relating to them to fluctuate. Market risks encompass interest rate, currency and other price risks (such as commodity prices and share prices).
Price risks:
The msg life Group is not exposed to any price risks.
Information on risk concentration (concentration risks):
The company does not have any dependencies on the procurement side. On the sales side, there tend to be concentrations of risk due to the geographic distribu- tion of turnover. For example, Germany accounts for an 88.8 per cent share of turnover (previous year: 85.0 per cent).
Interest rate risks:
Interest rate risks result from a fluctuation in the fair val- ue or future cash flows of a financial instrument due to changes in market interest rates.
Within trade receivables, there is no significant con- centration on individual customers. In the year under review, the ten largest customers accounted for a 64.0 per cent share of turnover (previous year: 61.1 per cent) and a 33.7 per cent share of trade receivables (previous year: 37.9 per cent).

///Retrieved document 2: In terms of credit risk, the Group is only exposed to risk in relation to trade receivables. Adequate valuation al- lowances have been made to cover the estimated de- fault risk. As the credit rating of clients in the insurance industry is generally good, the receivables are not in- sured. The maximum default risk is in principle equiva- lent to the nominal values less the valuation allowances. There is no other loan collateral and there are no other risk-mitigating agreements (such as guarantees, land charges or pledges) in place. Usage reservations exist until payment is complete. For invoiced receivables, the net balance of additions to and reversals of valuation allowances was 819,000 euros (previous year: 14,000 euros). On each effective date, trade receivables do not include any carrying amounts for which terms have been renegotiated and which would otherwise be over- due.
With regard to the analysis of trade receivables which are overdue but not impaired as at the end of the report- ing period, the reader is referred to section IV ‘Notes on the statement of financial position’, number 3 ‘Trade receivables’ in the notes.

The potential risks to the msg life Group associated with financial instruments consist notably of liquidity risks – which can result in a company being unable to raise the funds needed to settle its financial liabilities – currency risks resulting from its activities in various currency ar- eas, default risks arising from the non-fulfilment of con- tractual obligations by contracting parties and interest rate risks caused by movements in the market interest rate leading to a change in the fair value of a financial instrument and interest-related cash flow risks, which lead to a change in the future cash flows of a financial instrument due to changes in market interest rates.
Organisation:
The company has organised its risk management pro- cess along clear, functional lines. Specific tasks have been assigned to the individual organisational units involved in the risk management process. More infor- mation is available under ‘General’ in this section.
There are no default risks in relation to cash and cash equivalents. These are invested at banks with good rat- ings.

Opportunity and risk report
General
All the following estimations regarding opportunities and risks were made on the reporting date, 31 Decem- ber 2021.
In the type of business it conducts, the msg life Group is exposed to a large number of uncertainties which, if realised, can affect the Group’s earnings, financial and assets position, and that of the company, either posi- tively or negatively, or result in msg life falling short of or exceeding the targets it has set itself for the future development of its business.
pliance management were incorporated into the early risk detection system. The corresponding risk report for 2021 was presented to the Supervisory Board in Febru- ary 2022.
In 2021, the msg life Group’s profile did not change sig- nificantly with regard to the main types of opportunity and risk areas to which it is exposed. Below, individual types of risk that are identified as being important are explained in greater detail. The specification of these risks does not imply that other risks which have not been mentioned will not have a significant impact on msg life’s earnings, financial and assets position.
Among the Management Board’s most important tasks in the overall management of the Group are, in close coordination with the Supervisory Board, laying down general conditions and processes of risk management for the msg life Group, monitoring the degree of com- pliance with them and, in conjunction with the heads of the operating units and the administrative departments, regularly analysing the development of risks in the re- spective segments.
The msg life Group’s risk management system is docu- mented in a risk manual. One employee in the holding company’s Organisation & IT Services division has been appointed risk manager of the Group and is thereby en- trusted with submitting the prevailing risk management system to regular internal evaluation and documenting this process. It is the responsibility of the managers of the individual divisions to continuously monitor and deal with the risks to which their own divisions are ex- posed.
The foundation of good risk management is the reliable and prompt provision of the management with relevant information about the course of business. For this pur- pose, msg life has set up a monthly controlling and re- porting system.

msg life’s success depends crucially on the skills, qual- ifications and motivation of its employees. Certain em- ployees in key positions are particularly important in this respect. If msg life is unable to get these employ- ees to commit themselves to the company or to recruit qualified and skilled employees and develop them fur- ther on a continuous basis, msg life’s success can suffer significant adverse effects due to the resultant loss of expertise. In addition, an excessive burden on the com- pany’s own employees could necessitate the deploy- ment of expensive external capacities if the risk of qual- ity losses in project development is to be averted. This applies particularly when the likely demographic trends are taken into consideration. In connection with this, msg life will be affected particularly by the probable de- cline in graduate numbers, the resultant competition to recruit them and the increasing costs this will lead to.
msg life counters this risk with an extensive set of mea- sures. A continuous exchange of views with the em- ployees on all factors affecting their work environment at standardised interviews with a facility for qualified feedback, internal training to prevent monopolies of knowledge and skills, on-the-job graduate training and the recruitment of suitable people through all of the usual market channels are just a few examples of these.

Economic risks
Technological risks
The general economic trend affects the behaviour of potential customers as far as their investment in IT in- frastructure and their expenditure on ongoing manage- ment consulting are concerned. An economic downturn could reduce the volume of the market on which msg life has trained its sights. Any capacity adjustment mea- sures which are regarded as necessary to counter such developments might take effect only after a time lag and would lead to restructuring costs. With the volume-re- lated remuneration models, a delay in portfolio growth caused by the general economic situation could result in a postponement of the planned diminution in fixed costs.

The main potential source of risk in the course of op- erating activity lies in the calculation of the complex projects and in their organisational, functional, techni- cal and commercial handling. These risks are controlled and monitored by means of the valid Group-wide stan- dards for project and project risk management. The risk nevertheless remains that projects cannot be realised profitably for the msg life Group because costs exceed the agreed budget, deadlines cannot be met or the ser- vices rendered fail to comply with the agreed functional specifications or the required quality, and the msg life Group will therefore have to grant a discount or pay com- pensation. The overall risk profile of all ongoing projects was further reduced in 2021. The existing risks of indi- vidual projects have been appropriately taken into ac- count for 2022. The cumulative occurrence in multiple projects could, however, lead to negative effects.
In the 2021 financial year, particular attention was paid to the potential impact of the current Covid-19 pan- demic on the company. The company was quick to take comprehensive action in order to remain operational including, in particular, providing all employees with the necessary hardware and software to work remotely from home and moving almost all work to cyberspace both quickly and consistently. Nevertheless, there is a risk that msg life employees fall ill and are unable to work on customer projects or that customers are unable to perform the necessary supporting services. In turn, it might not be possible to reach agreed project mile- stones on time or at all, resulting in a negative impact on the economic development of the company.

///Retrieved document 1: The income and operating cash flows of the Group are not, on the whole, exposed to any interest rate risk. There are no significant interest rate risks in relation to its financial assets. The investment of cash and cash equivalents is done on a short-term basis and under- goes the normal market fluctuations. On the condition that all other parameters remained unchanged, the company assumes that interest rates were ten base points lower (higher) in the reporting period. In this case, the net result for 2021 would have been 8,000 euros lower (higher) (previous year: 8,000 euros lower (higher)) and the equity components would have been 8,000 euros lower (higher) (previous year: 8,000 euros lower (higher)).
In the reporting period as well as the previous year, there were no (interest-bearing) financial liabilities with variable interest rates.
Currency risks:
Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in exchange rates.
With regard to cash and cash equivalents, there is no concentration on individual institutions.
Overall assessment of the opportunities and risks
msg life believes that, in light of the likelihood of their occurrence and their effects, the risks described above do not represent a threat to the company’s continued existence either individually or as a whole. Senior man- agement remains confident that the Group’s earning power constitutes a solid basis for the future develop- ment of its business and will generate the resources that will be necessary for the Group to pursue the op- portunities that present themselves. In view of its lead- ing position on the market, its functional and techno- logical innovative power, its committed employees and its processes for the early identification of risks, msg life is confident that, in 2022, it will again be able to deal successfully with the challenges that arise from the aforementioned risks.

none of these risks arose and, for this reason – and also because of the steps taken by msg life and the perfor- mance of its project business in the current financial year 2022 – the company still sees no significant effects on its operating and financial performance as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic at the time these financial state- ments were prepared.
Product- and service-specific opportunities
In addition, msg life’s employees are crucial to the company’s innovative power and the customers’ value added – and are therefore instrumental in the growth and profitability of the msg life Group as a whole. More information about the future opportunities being gener- ated by msg life’s employees can be found in the ‘Em- ployees’ chapter within this condensed management report and Group management report.
Like all software products, the msg life Group’s pro- ducts can have defects whose elimination under guar- antee increases costs and thereby influences the profit margin or even leads to compensation claims against the msg life Group. The msg life companies generally assume the warranty which is customary in the indus- try. As far as possible, liability obligations are limited contractually to the legal minimum and are secured with appropriate liability insurance policies. It can neverthe- less not be entirely ruled out that contractually agreed limitations on liability will be regarded as invalid and the existing insurance cover will be available to an in- sufficient extent or not at all – even if this is improbable.
Risk assessment
The following risks are listed in descending order based on their estimated probability of occurrence and im- pacts. Additionally, unless indicated otherwise, the following disclosures concern all the fields of business.
Project and product risks

The purpose of liquidity man- agement is to finance predictable deficits at standard market terms under normal market conditions. This means that losses from both borrowing capital at exces- sive interest rates as well as investing surplus funds at interest rates below the market level should be avoided.
Credit risks (default risks):
Credit risk arises from deteriorating economic circum- stances of the company’s debtors or counterparties. Firstly, this results in a risk of partial or complete default on contractually agreed payments and, secondly, in a reduction in the value of financial instruments due to a poorer credit rating.
Credit risk management is responsible for the opera- tional measurement and management of credit risks. Its functions include, in particular, monitoring credit risk positions and exposure and analysis of credit ratings.
Because of the company’s current holdings of cash and cash equivalents, msg life ag considers the liquidity risk to be low at present. The msg life Group has sufficient liquid funds to enable it to service its financial liabili- ties.
As at the balance sheet date, the company had loan agreements with three banks totalling 7.500 million eu- ros. As at the reporting date, the loans had been used in the amount of 1.560 million euros for security deposits.

1,"Some of the economic risks that could impact the company include a decline in demand due to economic crises, reductions in turnover from postponed investments, and potential damage to earnings and the future of the company from system breakdowns or attacks.","///Retrieved document 0: In the event of demand falling as a consequence of economic crises, msg life assumes that this would take effect rather more slowly among existing product cus- tomers because, in that segment, loyalty to the solution deployed ensures that any requisite adjustments will also be ordered. With regard to new customers, post- ponements of planned investments can lead to reduc- tions in turnover, especially in product business.
As with all comparable companies, the functional ca- pacity of the business processes is also dependent on the availability and secure operational capacity of the IT infrastructure. External events such as fire, lengthy power or network failures, operational errors or acts of sabotage can, among other things, render the IT infra- structure inoperable. The msg life systems, and also those of its customers, can succumb to viruses which damage and incapacitate the systems or the network. Internal or external attacks can damage, distort or de- lete information and can result in confidential data and information being accessed. The probability and the extent of damage caused by viruses and hackers, by unauthorised persons accessing the IT system and by confidential information being accessed cannot be esti- mated to the fullest extent.
Recovery expenses, loss of production and recourse claims from customers and third parties as a result of system breakdowns or attacks could cause significant damage which, in turn, could influence earnings and endanger the future of the company.
All of the aforementioned economic risks also apply to the current Covid-19 pandemic. In light of the develop- ment of its business with new and existing customers and its project business in the reporting period and in 2022 so far, the company does not foresee any signif- icant impact on its economic or operational develop- ment at the time of writing of these annual financial statements.
The aforementioned economic risks also apply to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February of this year and the resulting economic sanctions against Russia. It is impossible to judge the economic effects of this cri- sis on the course of business of the msg life Group in 2022. At the time of preparation of the annual financial statements, however, msg life does not expect any sig- nificant changes to its economic or operational devel- opment.

Access restrictions prevent potentially infected software from being installed on the msg life comput- er network without authorisation.

Risks from takeovers
Competition risks
With its solutions, msg life is a leading sector-based service provider for life insurers and pension funds in Europe and in particular for health and group insurers in the United States. This has led to a concentration and therefore an increase in market development risks. At the same time, this increases the company’s profitabil- ity. msg life will therefore attempt to persevere with its existing strategy, including in its current product seg- ments and regional markets, and to cover entire value chains and product ranges with its solutions. In this way, it hopes to achieve a decisive competitive advantage on the market, particularly vis-à-vis new competitors with aggressive pricing policies.
msg life is currently interested in expanding its market position in German-speaking countries and internation- ally, primarily through organic growth. This can also be supported in parallel by strategic acquisitions. The suc- cess of an acquisition is dependent upon whether the acquired company can be successfully integrated in the Group structure and the desired synergy effects can be generated.
Liquidity risks
Managing liquidity risk includes ensuring that the com- pany always has sufficient liquid funds or credit lines available to enable it to meet its payment obligations and hedge against risks resulting from fluctuations in payment flows. Among other things, the payment ob- ligations consist of interest and redemption payments.

The main potential source of risk in the course of op- erating activity lies in the calculation of the complex projects and in their organisational, functional, techni- cal and commercial handling. These risks are controlled and monitored by means of the valid Group-wide stan- dards for project and project risk management. The risk nevertheless remains that projects cannot be realised profitably for the msg life Group because costs exceed the agreed budget, deadlines cannot be met or the ser- vices rendered fail to comply with the agreed functional specifications or the required quality, and the msg life Group will therefore have to grant a discount or pay com- pensation. The overall risk profile of all ongoing projects was further reduced in 2021. The existing risks of indi- vidual projects have been appropriately taken into ac- count for 2022. The cumulative occurrence in multiple projects could, however, lead to negative effects.
In the 2021 financial year, particular attention was paid to the potential impact of the current Covid-19 pan- demic on the company. The company was quick to take comprehensive action in order to remain operational including, in particular, providing all employees with the necessary hardware and software to work remotely from home and moving almost all work to cyberspace both quickly and consistently. Nevertheless, there is a risk that msg life employees fall ill and are unable to work on customer projects or that customers are unable to perform the necessary supporting services. In turn, it might not be possible to reach agreed project mile- stones on time or at all, resulting in a negative impact on the economic development of the company.

Overall assessment of the opportunities and risks
msg life believes that, in light of the likelihood of their occurrence and their effects, the risks described above do not represent a threat to the company’s continued existence either individually or as a whole.

cluding in light of the steps taken by msg life and the development of its business with new and existing cus- tomers and projects in the 2022 financial year so far.
The development of the policy management system msg.Life Factory and its components on the basis of innovative, cloud-native architecture remains a core project in terms of products. In 2022, msg life will ear- mark approximately 11,400 person-days in develop- ment capacity for this and for the further convergence of the components of msg.Life Factory into msg.Insurance Suite.
In connection with msg.Insurance Suite, msg life is still experiencing strong market demand with regard to mi- gration. The company is therefore continuing to hone its own expertise in the migration of entire platforms and is focusing on the further acceleration of migration pro- jects through innovative approaches such as AI, auto- mation and expanded correction processes.
In its consulting business, msg life also relies on its unique selling point of being able to transfer tried-and- tested solutions from the msg life product area even to non-product customers more cost-effectively than any of its competitors.
With regard to the ongoing global Covid-19 pandemic, msg life still sees no significant impacts on the oper- ational or economic development of the company, in-
In the 2022 financial year, msg life expects Group earn- ings before interest, taxes, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortisation of intangible assets (EBITDA) of between 14.0 and 18.0 million euros and gross Group revenue from its own business of be- tween 165.0 and 180.0 million euros in accordance with German GAAP.
As the holding company, the individual Group company expects a positive result under HGB in the 2022 finan- cial year.

More information about the future opportunities being gener- ated by msg life’s employees can be found in the ‘Em- ployees’ chapter within this condensed management report and Group management report.

As far as possible, liability obligations are limited contractually to the legal minimum and are secured with appropriate liability insurance policies.

msg life’s success depends crucially on the skills, qual- ifications and motivation of its employees. Certain em- ployees in key positions are particularly important in this respect. If msg life is unable to get these employ- ees to commit themselves to the company or to recruit qualified and skilled employees and develop them fur- ther on a continuous basis, msg life’s success can suffer significant adverse effects due to the resultant loss of expertise. In addition, an excessive burden on the com- pany’s own employees could necessitate the deploy- ment of expensive external capacities if the risk of qual- ity losses in project development is to be averted. This applies particularly when the likely demographic trends are taken into consideration. In connection with this, msg life will be affected particularly by the probable de- cline in graduate numbers, the resultant competition to recruit them and the increasing costs this will lead to.
msg life counters this risk with an extensive set of mea- sures. A continuous exchange of views with the em- ployees on all factors affecting their work environment at standardised interviews with a facility for qualified feedback, internal training to prevent monopolies of knowledge and skills, on-the-job graduate training and the recruitment of suitable people through all of the usual market channels are just a few examples of these. In addition, the leadership guidelines for managers are designed to strengthen the employees’ identification with the company.

Economic risks
Technological risks
The general economic trend affects the behaviour of potential customers as far as their investment in IT in- frastructure and their expenditure on ongoing manage- ment consulting are concerned. An economic downturn could reduce the volume of the market on which msg life has trained its sights. Any capacity adjustment mea- sures which are regarded as necessary to counter such developments might take effect only after a time lag and would lead to restructuring costs. With the volume-re- lated remuneration models, a delay in portfolio growth caused by the general economic situation could result in a postponement of the planned diminution in fixed costs.

As part of the ongoing ISO 27001 certification project, the management of information security risks has been expanded further within the overriding central risk management system.
Strategic opportunities
msg life regards the continuation of regulation through- out the insurance sector as a direct consequence of the financial crisis. Like the ongoing low-interest phase, this regulation is necessitating a great deal of adapta- tion with regard to the solutions currently used in the insurance sector and is reinforcing the trend towards the use of standard software and cross-sector platform solutions – such as those offered by msg life. At this time, the situation in the insurance market is proving to be an opportunity for the company, as demonstrated by the new contracts over the past few years and current sales projects.
In the past, the Group company FJA-US, Inc. profited from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) which was enacted in 2013 in terms of both turnover and earnings. After the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act suffered from a lack of support from the Trump administration, the Biden administra- tion pressed on with an improvement to the Patient Pro- tection and Affordable Care Act in late 2021 in the form of the Build Back Better Act. As a result, state healthcare programmes such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid can be expected to grow further. Thanks to its now well-established partnerships with leading providers such as Companion Data Services, the msg life Group company in the USA can offer end-to-end ser- vices including claims handling. Additionally, the com- pany successfully expanded its related activities in the health and group insurance market and further diversi- fied its range of services.
Opportunities from regulatory developments
In accordance with the current version of the guideline, monthly reports were prepared on the most significant risks and the operative and central divisional managers and employees with special positions in terms of risks were surveyed three times per year.

involving an enormous number of resources. In 2021, the European Commission presented its proposed revi- sion of the regulatory regime Solvency II which has been in force since 2016. The legislative procedure current- ly involves the European Parliament and the European Council. According to the GDV, the amendments should remain balanced because Solvency II has proven itself so far.
cation ‘Insurance IT: A key to greater sustainability’ pub- lished in January 2022, software standardisation, the replacement of legacy systems and cloud computing are among the most important IT projects. According to Branchenkompass Insurance 2021, the replacement of legacy systems with cloud computing IT is considered a recurring theme in the industry. It reports that more than 60 per cent of insurers are currently working to mi- grate to cloud-based solutions.
In March 2021, the European Commission introduced the Transparency Directive (Sustainable Finance Dis- closure Regulation; SFDR) for financial service provid- ers. The directive governs the disclosure obligations of pro duct providers and financial advisors in terms of sustainability in strategies, processes and products. The regulatory requirements also apply to insurance brokers, life insurers and providers of company pension schemes. The Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) that expand on the directive are expected to apply from mid- 2022 onwards. This will increase the amount of regula- tory paperwork for life insurers and providers of compa- ny pension schemes.
With regard to old-age pensions, the German govern- ment has also decided to introduce a digital pension overview. It aims to provide customers with a quick over- view of their statutory, company and private pension en- titlements. The German Pension Overview Act (RentÜG) came into effect on 18 February 2021. The law requires all providers of private and company old-age pensions to connect to the portal if they are obliged to send regu- lar summaries to their customers while they are paying into the pension. After a 21-month development phase, the platform is set to go live in autumn 2023.

Opportunity and risk report
General
All the following estimations regarding opportunities and risks were made on the reporting date, 31 Decem- ber 2021.
In the type of business it conducts, the msg life Group is exposed to a large number of uncertainties which, if realised, can affect the Group’s earnings, financial and assets position, and that of the company, either posi- tively or negatively, or result in msg life falling short of or exceeding the targets it has set itself for the future development of its business.
pliance management were incorporated into the early risk detection system. The corresponding risk report for 2021 was presented to the Supervisory Board in Febru- ary 2022.
In 2021, the msg life Group’s profile did not change sig- nificantly with regard to the main types of opportunity and risk areas to which it is exposed. Below, individual types of risk that are identified as being important are explained in greater detail. The specification of these risks does not imply that other risks which have not been mentioned will not have a significant impact on msg life’s earnings, financial and assets position.
Among the Management Board’s most important tasks in the overall management of the Group are, in close coordination with the Supervisory Board, laying down general conditions and processes of risk management for the msg life Group, monitoring the degree of com- pliance with them and, in conjunction with the heads of the operating units and the administrative departments, regularly analysing the development of risks in the re- spective segments.
The msg life Group’s risk management system is docu- mented in a risk manual. One employee in the holding company’s Organisation & IT Services division has been appointed risk manager of the Group and is thereby en- trusted with submitting the prevailing risk management system to regular internal evaluation and documenting this process. It is the responsibility of the managers of the individual divisions to continuously monitor and deal with the risks to which their own divisions are ex- posed.
The foundation of good risk management is the reliable and prompt provision of the management with relevant information about the course of business. For this pur- pose, msg life has set up a monthly controlling and re- porting system.

///Retrieved document 2: Under the management mechanisms now in place, the daily holdings of cash and cash equivalents and the monthly rolling financial plans are monitored by the company’s management. The purpose of liquidity man- agement is to finance predictable deficits at standard market terms under normal market conditions. This means that losses from both borrowing capital at exces- sive interest rates as well as investing surplus funds at interest rates below the market level should be avoided.
Credit risks (default risks):
Credit risk arises from deteriorating economic circum- stances of the company’s debtors or counterparties. Firstly, this results in a risk of partial or complete default on contractually agreed payments and, secondly, in a reduction in the value of financial instruments due to a poorer credit rating.
Credit risk management is responsible for the opera- tional measurement and management of credit risks. Its functions include, in particular, monitoring credit risk positions and exposure and analysis of credit ratings.
Because of the company’s current holdings of cash and cash equivalents, msg life ag considers the liquidity risk to be low at present. The msg life Group has sufficient liquid funds to enable it to service its financial liabili- ties.
As at the balance sheet date, the company had loan agreements with three banks totalling 7.500 million eu- ros. As at the reporting date, the loans had been used in the amount of 1.560 million euros for security deposits.
Risk reporting in respect of the use of financial instruments
Objective and methods of financial risk management:
Financial risk management is designed to put the msg life Group in a position to recognise all the significant risks to which it is potentially exposed at an early stage and to take appropriate countermeasures.

Shareholders’ rights and duties
Shareholders have property and administrative rights. The property rights include, in particular, the right to participate in profits (section 58, paragraph 4, of the German Stock Corporation Act – AktG) and liquidation proceeds (section 271 of the AktG), as well as pre-emp- tion rights to shares in the event of capital increases (section 186 of the AktG).
The administrative rights include the right to attend the annual general meeting and speak, ask questions, put forward motions and exercise voting rights. Sharehold- ers can assert these rights by initiating, in particular, actions for information and rescission.
Each share guarantees one vote at the annual general meeting. The annual general meeting elects the mem- bers of the Supervisory Board and the auditor of the financial statements; it decides, in particular, on the formal approval of the actions of the members of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board, alter- ations to the articles of incorporation, corporate action, empowerment to acquire treasury shares and, if re- quired, the conducting of a special audit, the premature dismissal of members of the Supervisory Board and a dissolution of the company.

Capital reserves include the amount received in excess of the nominal price when shares are issued. By 31 December 2021, as in the previous year, the capital reserves totalled 11,704,846.80 euros.
Only the restrictions of section 150 of the AktG on the payment of dividends or repay- ment of capital apply to the capital reserve.
11. Group revenue reserves
The Group revenue reserves include the profits of the companies within the scope of the consolidated financial statements, unless they have been paid out as dividends.
12. Equity difference from foreign currency translation
Differences arising from currency conversion, with no impact on earnings, from the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are included in this balance sheet item.

13. Net accumulated losses of the Group and appropriation of net profit
The statement of financial position has been prepared with consideration for the ap- propriation of some of the net income for the year. The net accumulated losses of 10.352 million euros as at 31 December 2021 (previous year: 22.494 million euros) consist of a loss carryforward of 22.494 million euros (previous year: 30.798 million euros) and net income for the year of 12.142 million euros (previous year: 8.304 mil- lion euros).
Under the German Stock Corporation Act, dividends available for distribution depend on the net profit which msg life ag declares in its financial statements, drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code. The company is not in a position to distribute dividends.
No dividend is anticipated for the 2021 financial year.
14. Pension provisions
Pension agreements exist for the parent company and for one domestic and one for- eign subsidiary within the msg life Group in the form of direct defined-benefit ob- ligations. In defined-benefit plans, the employer undertakes to make the promised pension payments and to finance them by forming pension provisions or separate plan assets for pension purposes.

With regard to the US market, msg life is currently exam- ining whether it would be possible to deploy a localised version of its portfolio of European life insurance prod- ucts in connection with its specific US products as an integrated solution. Overall, msg life continues to enjoy steady growth in the various insurance sectors in the US market and intends to exploit the potential for business that this represents. In addition to the implementation and integration of specific software products, the range of services offered by msg life encompasses a variety of consulting services in connection with product and tar- iff modelling, for example, as well as operator models – these are generating growing interest in the market.
The target group of the msg life Group company there is predominantly health and group insurers and, in fu- ture, will also include life insurers on the basis of the US product portfolio. The expansion and diversification of the company’s own range of solutions and partner- ships with specialised service providers are being used to unlock new customer groups. Now that the Biden ad- ministration has built on the Patient Protection and Af- fordable Care Act, msg life expects the state healthcare programmes such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid to grow further with the sales opportu- nities this provides. In the US market, msg life is also examining the potential for a commercial partnership in the field of health insurance.
Following an excellent 2021 financial year, msg life is registering a high level of demand for solutions in the first quarter of the current 2022 financial year – from insurance companies in Germany and other countries in equal measure. In this context, msg life also expects to see further regulation throughout the financial ser- vices sector. Be it the revision of Solvency II, the new international accounting standard IFRS 17, the Europe- an Transparency Directive, the rollout of a digital pen- sion overview or the introduction of PEPP, the ongoing implementation of numerous regulatory requirements necessitates comprehensive changes to the solutions which are currently used and ties up vast amounts of insurers’ resources. This means that the use of versatile, cost-effective standard software remains highly attrac- tive throughout the insurance industry.

In connection with its ongoing internationalisation strategy, msg life and IBM have entered into a partner- ship to open up new insurance markets. The goal is to significantly increase the competitiveness of interna- tional insurance companies through a fully digitised end-to-end solution, thereby securing their future.
In the past, the strategic presence of msg life in each foreign market was an important success factor when it came to attracting new customers. It is also becoming more and more apparent that Group companies want to put the solutions implemented for one region at the disposal of other Group companies in other countries – which can advance the ongoing internationalisation of msg life as a service provider for its customers. Besides the established partnership with IBM, the objective in the 2022 financial year is to press ahead with ma- jor sales projects, especially in the established foreign markets, as in the 2021 financial year.
The Benelux countries are an important market in this regard, where msg life, in cooperation with IBM, gained its largest new customer so far in AEGON in the Nether- lands, and is now working on the related introductory project.
The Austrian market is also a cornerstone of msg life’s international activities: msg life has enjoyed a number of highly significant successes there in recent years. The placement and further development of the consulting portfolio for the German-language markets and the mar- keting of msg life products in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is carried out from Vienna. On the Swiss market, too, msg life sees good prospects for the further expansion of its business and is represent- ed with its own offices and by various well-known life insurers such as AXA and Schweizerische Mobiliar. An innovative, AI-based and previously unique migration solution developed by msg life will be used at AXA in 2023 in the context of the acquisition of the legacy port- folio.

For the company, the 2021 financial year was again overshadowed by the restrictions on working in offices and on customers’ premises due to the pandemic, as well as the extremely high percentage of employees who worked from home. As the company was able to master this decentralised way of working largely with- out issue in the second year of the pandemic, it has laid a robust cornerstone for the future of work organisation at msg life. The company took the various services it of- fers to support employees and their families further in 2021, and made further improvements to this field with a service provider and its extensive range of options and services.
The onboarding process for new employees was almost exclusively remote and digitised in 2021. msg life has been holding welcome and introductory events for all new employees for years. In the course of these on- boarding sessions, the strategic orientation of the com- pany is presented, as well as its targets in each field of business. The aim is also to give the new colleagues a broad network within the entire company as quickly as possible. In 2021, msg life took on the challenge of sup- porting new employees with a structured onboarding scheme. Innovative online collaboration formats, which are now well established, advanced and more profes- sional, were used for these purposes.
In order to find new employees, the company offers re- cruitment opportunities in various job profiles and at various career levels. msg life uses the networks and expertise of employees within the sector; a recommen- dation programme has been established and will be expanded. In addition to its own networks, the Internet remains the most important medium for achieving the company’s recruitment success. msg life thus places emphasis on using relevant online channels, far-reach- ing platforms as well as niche job markets, and im- plements its strategies in the fields of search engine optimisation and search engine advertising by using target-group-specific landing pages.

msg life promotes employees as part of its in-house ‘life talent’ programme. Using a structured selection process, employees are identified as talents if they are developing very quickly and positively and they have the potential to take on a strategic and leading role in the company in the future. Within the programme, the participants identify their own strategic topics, work in- dependently on questions and projects and take their results back to the company with the approval of the Management Board. In addition to individual support and professional development of the employees, the central goals of the programme, which starts on an annual basis, is good networking and long-term reten- tion of the talents in the company, as well as allowing knowledge to be transferred as broadly, quickly and pragmatically as possible, in particular with regard to new topics. Within this context, the practised reality of flat hierarchies at msg life is both the foundation as well as the target of the successful implementation of the programme. The talent programme will be expand- ed and extended with a high-potential programme from 2022 onwards.

Special importance is attached to close com- munication with the market and customers as their as- sessment of the products’ relevance to business success is crucial. The msg life Group therefore attaches a great deal of importance to its cooperation with customers in the user and operator groups as well as with partners (IBM or the msg Group, for example) in relation to its most important products. The approaches devised with-
in the framework of research are presented, discussed and evaluated within the user and operator groups at an early stage and, if required, on a cross-product basis. The evaluation is conducted with particular regard to users’ interest in acquiring the product enhancements. In this way, new releases of standard software products are generally partially financed by advance orders from some of the customers.
As there are no user groups that can be accessed for the placement of new products or the opening up of new markets, early customer models are used which reward a customer’s early decision in favour of a new product with commercial benefits.
Purchasing R & D expertise
In its capacity as market leader in its core business, the msg life Group is usually unable to have recourse to ready-made external research findings. This particularly applies to specialist thematic areas in the customers’ sectors. As a sector-specific service provider, the com-

pany prefers to rely on its own research, which builds upon its participation in trade conferences, association activities and joint projects with partner companies. Fu- ture trends, too, can usually be identified more reliably on the basis of the systematic reviewing of customer requirements from projects and canvassing situations than on the basis of external surveys. It goes without saying that the qualification level of the Group’s em- ployees is updated continuously by means of selective (also external) ongoing training activities. In the tech- nology sector, msg life makes use of rapidly develop- ing standards and non-proprietary technologies right
through to freely available open-source products. The company also safeguards the quality of its own techno- logical orientation by maintaining close partnerships with IBM and with selected colleges and universities.
R & D expenditure

EARNINGS POSITION
In the reporting year, current assets increased from 74.5 million euros in the previous year to 92.3 million euros. Essentially, this development was due to the fact that securities were 12.4 million euros higher and accounts receivable were 6.9 million euros higher as at the re- porting date. On the other hand, liquid funds decreased by 5.0 million euros from 22.9 million euros to 17.9 mil- lion euros, which had the opposite effect.
Compared to the previous year, turnover decreased by 6.5 million euros from 56.5 million euros to 50.0 million euros. This development was driven by turnover from third parties which decreased by 9.4 million euros, and internal turnover (i.e. turnover from companies within the msg life Group) which increased by 2.9 million eu- ros. Other operating income came to 0.4 million euros (previous year: 0.6 million euros).
The net total of the line item ‘Inventories’ has increased from 4.3 million euros to 7.5 million euros as payments received on account and work in progress exceeded the payments received on account of customer projects as at the reporting date. Due to the chosen method of open recognition, the net amount of 7.5 million euros has been recognised under inventories.

Focus of R & D activities
For msg life, research and development (R & D) serves not only to develop and expand standard software solu- tions, but also to extend its consulting expertise. Such expertise manifests itself in the strategic development of employee know-how, as well as in the further de- velopment of software tools that give efficient support to the consulting activities. Needless to say, all R & D activities are subject to the imperative of sustainable cost-efficiency.

Dear Shareholders,
The Supervisory Board diligently performed the duties incumbent on it according to the law, articles of association and rules of procedure in the 2021 financial year and, in this context, monitored the activities of the Management Board of msg life ag in managing the company, guiding it in an advisory capacity. It compared actual business performance against its targets at each meeting and scrutinised the operational and strategic performance of the company in detail. The reasons behind any divergences and their possible knock-on effects on the company’s short, medium and long-term plans were also discussed.

1,"The headquarters of the msg life Group is located in Leinfelden-Echterdingen, Germany.","///Retrieved document 0: The business of msg life in the United States for primar- ily health and group insurers was satisfactory up to the end of the reporting period. FJA-US, Inc. – the msg life Group company located in the United States – record- ed continuous successful development with solutions such as the Unified Distribution Platform, the Unified Product Platform and the web-based multi-channel platform msg.Sales. In the 2021 financial year, the com- pany attracted two new, well-known customers from the health and life insurance segments and recorded over- all growth in customer demand for services.
msg life serves the Spanish and Portuguese markets with an office in Spain and its own local office in Portu- gal which is now also being used as a product develop- ment unit. The development of msg life’s business with existing customers in that market was positive again in 2021 and it successfully managed to launch the project for its new customer, the non-life insurance company SegurCaixa Adeslas. Moreover, an acquisition was com- pleted successfully for Mutual Medica in Spain and the project began shortly after the end of the reporting peri- od. msg life continues to expect sales successes in that market in the current year.
msg life is serving the Central and Eastern European markets as well as other niche markets and segments from Slovenia in particular; as German-language in- surers are particularly striving to access these highly competitive markets, they regularly offer interesting sales opportunities for msg life. The company has a presence in many Eastern European countries with the Unified Administration Platform (UAP). As a result of the growing consulting business that is developing in connection with its local presences, msg life expects these markets to generate cross-selling effects. In the reporting period, SwissCaution awarded a contract to roll out the UAP. msg life received another contract for this system from Calingo Insurance AG in Switzerland, as well as from Zurich Cantonal Bank shortly after the end of the reporting period.
As previously reported, there were numerous new or- ders for msg life in 2021 and the company expects rele- vant new business in the 2022 financial year. Business with existing customers in connection with the software components was also strong. Additionally, nearly all of the major projects set out in the corporate plan were executed in the reporting period. As in previous years, msg life focused on sales projects in well-established markets in particular in the 2021 financial year.

With regard to the US market, msg life is currently exam- ining whether it would be possible to deploy a localised version of its portfolio of European life insurance prod- ucts in connection with its specific US products as an integrated solution. Overall, msg life continues to enjoy steady growth in the various insurance sectors in the US market and intends to exploit the potential for business that this represents. In addition to the implementation and integration of specific software products, the range of services offered by msg life encompasses a variety of consulting services in connection with product and tar- iff modelling, for example, as well as operator models – these are generating growing interest in the market.
The target group of the msg life Group company there is predominantly health and group insurers and, in fu- ture, will also include life insurers on the basis of the US product portfolio. The expansion and diversification of the company’s own range of solutions and partner- ships with specialised service providers are being used to unlock new customer groups. Now that the Biden ad- ministration has built on the Patient Protection and Af- fordable Care Act, msg life expects the state healthcare programmes such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid to grow further with the sales opportu- nities this provides. In the US market, msg life is also examining the potential for a commercial partnership in the field of health insurance.
Following an excellent 2021 financial year, msg life is registering a high level of demand for solutions in the first quarter of the current 2022 financial year – from insurance companies in Germany and other countries in equal measure. In this context, msg life also expects to see further regulation throughout the financial ser- vices sector. Be it the revision of Solvency II, the new international accounting standard IFRS 17, the Europe- an Transparency Directive, the rollout of a digital pen- sion overview or the introduction of PEPP, the ongoing implementation of numerous regulatory requirements necessitates comprehensive changes to the solutions which are currently used and ties up vast amounts of insurers’ resources. This means that the use of versatile, cost-effective standard software remains highly attrac- tive throughout the insurance industry.

Responsibility of the legal representatives and Supervisory Board for the consolidated financial statements, condensed management report and Group management report
The legal representatives are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated fi- nancial statements that comply, in all material respects, with German GAAP, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, financial and earnings position of the Group. In addition, the legal representatives are responsible for such internal controls as they have deemed necessary in line with German GAAP to enable the preparation of con- solidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the legal representatives are re- sponsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.
Furthermore, the legal representatives are responsible for the preparation of the con- densed management report and Group management report that, as a whole, provide an appropriate view of the Group’s position and are, in all material respects, consis- tent with the consolidated financial statements, comply with German legal require- ments, and appropriately present the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the legal representatives are responsible for such precautions and mea- sures (systems) as they deem necessary to enable the preparation of a condensed management report and Group management report that are consistent with the ap- plicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the condensed management report and Group man- agement report.

Furthermore, the legal representatives are responsible for the preparation of the con- densed management report and Group management report that, as a whole, provide an appropriate view of the Group’s position and are, in all material respects, consis- tent with the consolidated financial statements, comply with German legal require- ments, and appropriately present the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the legal representatives are responsible for such precautions and mea- sures (systems) as they deem necessary to enable the preparation of a condensed management report and Group management report that are consistent with the ap- plicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the condensed management report and Group man- agement report.
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

---------------------------
///Retrieved document 1: — Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the legal represen- tatives and the reasonableness of estimates made by the legal representatives and related disclosures;
— Conclude on the appropriateness of the legal representatives’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signif- icant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the audi- tor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, condensed management report and Group management report or, if such disclo- sures are inadequate, to modify our opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern;
— Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated fi- nancial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated fi- nancial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, financial and earnings position of the Group in compliance with German GAAP;
— Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the condensed management report and Group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements. We are solely responsible for our opinions;
— Evaluate the consistency of the condensed management report and Group man- agement report with the consolidated financial statements, their conformity with the law and the view of the Group’s position they provide;
— Perform audit procedures on the prospective disclosures presented by the le- gal representatives in the condensed management report and Group manage- ment report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the legal representatives as a basis for the prospective information and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information

Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial state- ments, the condensed management report or the Group management report.
Basis for the opinions
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements, condensed man- agement report and Group management report in accordance with Section 317 HGB with consideration for the German Generally Accepted Standards on Auditing as pro- mulgated by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the section entitled ‘Responsibility of the auditor for the audit of the consolidated financial statements, condensed management report and Group management report’ in our auditor’s re- port. We are independent of the Group entities in accordance with the requirements of German commercial and professional law and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the condensed manage- ment report and Group management report.
Other information
The legal representatives and the Supervisory Board are responsible for the other in- formation. The other information comprises the remaining parts of the annual report with the exceptions of the consolidated financial statements, the audited condensed management report and Group management report and Group management report, as well as our auditor’s report.
Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements, condensed management report and Group management report do not cover the other information, and con- sequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Audit opinions
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of msg life ag and its subsid- iaries (the Group), consisting of the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2021, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated cash flow statement for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2021, as well as the notes to the consolidated financial statements including the presentation of accounting and valuation methods. Addi- tionally, we have audited the condensed management report and Group management report of msg life ag for the financial year from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021.
In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

///Retrieved document 1: The reporting currency is the euro, and the rounding is done to thousands or millions of euros. This can give rise to rounding differences of up to one arithmetical unit.
The consolidated financial statements are published in the German Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger) and deposited with the electronic register of companies under HRB 731 887 at Stuttgart Local Court (Amtsgericht). As at the reporting date, msg life ag is an indirect subsidiary of msg group GmbH, which prepares the consolidated financial statements for the largest number of Group companies.
On 25 September 2020, msg life ag, Leinfelden-Echterdingen, and msg systems ag, Ismaning, signed a control agreement, which was amended on 6 November 2020. The annual general meetings of msg life ag and msg systems approved this control agreement on 10 November 2020 and 18 November 2020 respectively. The control agreement took effect retroactively as of 1 January 2021 when it was entered in the commercial register for msg life ag at the Stuttgart District Court on 20 January 2021.
The global coronavirus pandemic continued unabated in 2021. Looking at the 2021 financial year, however, it is once again evident that the pandemic did not have a sig- nificant effect on msg life’s business. For this reason – and also because of the steps taken by msg life and the performance of its project business in the current financial year 2022 – the company still sees no significant effects on its operating and financial performance as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic at the time these financial state-

///Retrieved document 1: Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over an expected useful life. The expected useful life of software purchased from third parties is between three and 15 years.
The disposal in the financial assets concerns an interest in ARGE FJA KR BU-System, Munich, which has not been consolidated. The msg life Group had few means of par- ticipating in the financial and business decision-making processes of the company and as such has no significant influence over the company.
2.
Inventories
Inventories predominantly include as-yet-uninvoiced sales relating to customer or- ders. The amount stated includes some fixed-price projects, which have been capital- ised while observing the loss-free valuation rule.
Payments on account of unfinished purchased services totalling 28.300 million euros (previous year: 23.105 million euros) are attributable to a major project received in 2018 and have been paid to msg systems ag, Ismaning. These payments made on account are offset by payments totalling 28.888 million euros (previous year: 23.105 million euros) received on account from customers.
Payments received on account of orders totalling 54.730 million euros (previous year: 59.164 million euros) have been offset in full against inventories. This leaves net in- ventories of 7.541 million euros (previous year: 4.324 million euros).
3. Trade receivables
Trade receivables totalled 38.295 million euros as at 31 December 2021 (previous year: 34.722 million euros). Of this, 38.198 million euros (previous year: 34.576 mil- lion euros) are due within one year and 97,000 euros are due within five years.
4. Accounts due from affiliated companies
As in the previous year, the accounts due from affiliated companies of 3.504 million euros as at 31 December 2021 (previous year: 178,000 euros) were due within one year. This increase is due to the continuous expansion of the collaboration between msg life and the msg Group company msg nexinsure.
With regard to the composition of the accounts due from affiliated companies, see section VII. ‘Related parties’, number 3 ‘Other transactions with related parties’.

IX. Events after the reporting period
With regard to the ongoing global Covid-19 pandemic, msg life still sees no significant impacts on the operational or economic development of the company, including in light of the steps taken by msg life and the development of its business with new and existing customers and projects in the 2022 financial year so far.
In February of this year, after the end of the reporting period, Russia invaded Ukraine and economic sanctions were imposed on Russia as a result. It is impossible to judge the effects of this crisis on the course of business of the msg life Group in 2022. At the time of preparation of the annual financial statements, however, msg life does not expect any significant changes to its economic or operational development.
With regard to both of these topics, we also refer to the corresponding statements in the opportunity and risk report of the condensed management and Group manage- ment report for the 2021 financial year.
There were no further events after the reporting date.

The heads of these divisions and the managing directors comprise the next senior management level below the msg life ag Management Board.
In September 2021, pursuant to Section 52 (2) of the German Limited Liability Companies Act (GmbHG), the shareholders’ meeting of msg life central europe gmbh passed a resolution setting a target of (at least) 0% for the proportion of women on the Supervisory Board of msg life central europe gmbh and among the managing directors of msg life central europe gmbh by 31 Decem- ber 2025. The shareholders’ meeting is of the opinion that personal qualifications and ability, not gender, should be the decisive factor with regard to filling po- sitions on the Supervisory Board and among the man- aging directors. As such, no considerations that are not solely based on the candidate’s personal and profes- sional suitability for a role should be decisive.

Before they were netted against deferred tax liabilities, the deferred tax assets totalled 0.3 million euros (previous year: 0.4 million euros).
Expenses for the procurement of services were 11.6 mil- lion euros lower than in the previous year and amount- ed to 28.4 million euros in the financial year ended (pre- vious year: 40.0 million euros).
Both in the 2021 financial year and in the same period in the previous year, the development of msg life ag’s turnover and expenses resulting from the procurement of services was mainly due to the interim delivery of a milestone within the framework of a major project with msg systems ag.
At 8.4 million euros (previous year: 8.9 million euros), personnel expenses were just 0.5 million euros lower than the previous year.
Provisions decreased by a total of 1.8 million euros to 25.8 million euros. Essentially, this change was due to the decrease in other provisions by 2.7 million euros to 17.7 million euros.
The item of depreciation of property, plant and equip- ment from the separate financial statements prepared in accordance with German GAAP (HGB) decreased slightly to 0.4 million euros in the financial year ended (previous year: 0.5 million euros).
All in all, provisions account for 25.9 per cent of the balance sheet total, compared with 33.6 per cent in the previous year.
Liabilities amounted to 13.2 million euros. The increase of 4.4 million euros compared to the previous year is due to the increase in liabilities to affiliated companies of 3.6 million euros to 7.5 million euros, an increase in trade payables of 1.5 million euros and the decrease in other liabilities by 0.7 million euros to 2.6 million euros.

1,The sales of the Group in Germany in 2020 are not mentioned in the given context. The sales of the Group in the United States in 2020 decreased from 23.7 million euros to 17.6 million euros.,"///Retrieved document 0: Under the more difficult conditions of the Covid-19 pan- demic, the German insurance industry closed the 2021 financial year with a ‘solid’ performance, concludes Wolfgang Weiler, president of the Gesamtverband der Deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft (GDV), at its annual media conference in January 2022. He announced that insurers reported an increase in premiums of 1.1 per cent (previous year: 1.6 per cent) across all segments, reaching 223.4 billion euros.
The outlook for 2022 is cautiously optimistic. Accord- ing to the GDV, the industry expects premium growth of between 2 and 3 per cent. With regard to life insur- ance, the Covid-19 pandemic can be expected to have an impact on business prospects in the current year too. Premium growth of between 1 and 2 per cent could be considered realistic here. The GDV expects a weaker performance from traditional life insurance products, although market-oriented products are expected to grow more strongly. ‘The decisive factors here are the economic prospects of private households and the gen- eral political conditions for private old-age pensions in the current legislative period’, said Weiler.
The GDV goes on to report that the premium income of life insurers and pension funds amounted to around 102 billion euros in the financial year ended. That amount is 1.4 per cent lower than in 2020. Whereas current pre- mium income increased slightly to 65.3 billion euros, one-time premiums declined to 36.5 billion euros (-4.7 per cent).
According to the GDV, new Riester business performed well with growth of 12 per cent to 310,500 contracts. The portfolio largely remained stable, with around 10.4 mil- lion contracts. With regard to basic pensions, the num- ber of newly brokered policies increased by almost 40 per cent to 119,000 contracts. This caused the overall portfolio to grow by 4 per cent to 2.5 million contracts.

///Retrieved document 1: The economic performance of the manufacturing sector improved by 4.4 per cent year-on-year. The aggregated economic sector of trade, transport, accommodation and food services saw growth of just 3.0 per cent. Fol- lowing growth of 3.8 per cent in 2020, the construction sector reported a slight decline of 0.4 per cent. Other services, which include culture, entertainment, sports and creative activities, were hit particularly hard by the crisis: Their economic performance grew by just 0.6 per cent, following a decline of 10.5 per cent in the same period in the previous year.
In 2021, foreign trade recovered from the dramatic set- back it suffered in 2020. Germany exported 9.4 per cent more goods and services abroad than in the same pe- riod in the previous year. Imports grew by 8.6 per cent. This means that foreign trade in 2021 was only slightly below the level it had reached in 2019.
The German government expects the country’s econom- ic recovery to accelerate over the course of the year. That being said, it is set to be less strong than initial- ly predicted. ‘The impact of the coronavirus pandemic

continues to be felt’, says a press release published by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action in January 2022. In spite of this, the economy re- mains ‘robust’. The GDP is expected to grow by 3.6 per cent year-on-year. As such, economic performance will surpass its pre-crisis levels for the first time. As recent- ly as December 2021, major German economic institu- tions downgraded their forecasts for 2022. For example, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy lowered its GDP forecast from 5.1 per cent to 4.0 per cent and the Halle Institute for Economic Research downgraded its growth forecast from 4.8 per cent to 3.5 per cent.

The global coronavirus pandemic continued unabated in 2021. Looking at the 2021 financial year, however, it is once again evident that the pandemic did not have a sig- nificant effect on msg life’s business.

///Retrieved document 1: Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial calculations carried out using the projected unit credit method and with consider- ation for the 2018 G mortality tables from Professor Heubeck or the BVG 2015 gen- eration tables. The provisions for pensions and other obligations are discounted at the average market interest rate for the preceding ten years published by the German Central Bank for an assumed remaining term of 15 years.
Tax provisions have been set up to the amount of the anticipated tax burden (the settlement amount).
The other provisions are valued at the settlement amount allowing for all discernible risks, expected risks and anticipated increases in prices and costs. Provisions with terms exceeding one year are subject to the deduction of an average market rate of interest for the last seven years that is appropriate for the term of each provision as determined by the German Central Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank). The provision for severance payments is measured using the projected unit credit method. An actuarial interest rate of 1.1 per cent p.a. (previous year: 1.6 per cent p.a.) and a salary increase rate of 2.5 per cent p.a. (previous year: 1.45 per cent p.a.) were used in the calculation on each key date.
Liabilities are valued at the settlement amount on the statement of financial position date.
Advance payments received on account of orders are recognised at their net value. The company has made use of the option provided by section 268, paragraph 5, sen- tence 2, of the HGB to openly deduct payments received on account of inventories from the line item ‘Inventories’ on the assets side.
Income received prior to the reporting date is recognised under accruals and deferrals as long as it represents revenue for a specific time after the reporting date.
The deferred taxes are calculated in line with the temporary concept. According to the temporary concept, deferred taxes are formed for all temporary and virtually per- manent accounting and measurement differences between the values of assets and liabilities recognised under commercial and tax law.
When the deferred tax assets are determined, deferred tax assets on losses carried forward must be taken into account in the amount of the offset of losses that is to be expected within the next five years. Accordingly, no deferred tax assets were rec- ognised for tax losses on 31 December 2021, taking their realisability into account.

tions with artificial intelligence and integrate them into a modern system. Actuarial functions will be transfer- able automatically with AI and connected to a modern policy administration system. Trustworthy AI and au- tomated machine learning are two topics that play an important role in this context.
The project breaks new technological ground and will create a fundamentally new hybrid technology at the point where machine learning, software development and actuarial mathematics intersect. The work ties in closely with the work in an ongoing migration project for an msg life customer and will be subsidised for three years by the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs, Re- gional Development and Energy (StMWi).
Business with existing customers in 2021 was charac- terised by extremely stable, successful projects as well as a continuous flow of new contracts. The company ex- pects these developments to continue in 2022.
msg life was able to achieve sales successes in almost every region in which the company operated in 2021:
In the German-speaking market, the contracts for a proof of concept relating to the potential rollout of msg. Insurance Suite were signed with a well-known life in- surer and, shortly after the end of the reporting period, a start-up life insurer. Furthermore, the long-standing customer HUK-Coburg awarded contracts to roll out msg.RAN and msg.Tax Data. Likewise, the company was awarded contracts to roll out msg.Tax Data from Öffent- liche Versicherung Braunschweig and AXA Lebensver- sicherung AG. ERGO also placed an order to introduce msg.Life Product, the mathematical component of msg. Life Factory.
msg life is also cultivating the Benelux market inten- sively from the German-speaking countries. After gain- ing AEGON in the Netherlands as a customer in 2020, msg life is generating interest there with its range of products, especially from insurance groups which op- erate nationally.

The amount of the pension obligation is calculated by actuarial methods using the internationally accepted projected unit credit method, with future obligations being calculated on the basis of the proportional entitlements acquired on the reporting date. Evaluation takes account of assumed trends for the relevant variables which af- fect the amount of benefit. Actuarial calculations are required for all benefit systems.
Not only assumptions about life expectancy and incapacity, but also premises using the biometric principles of the 2018 G mortality tables from Professor Heubeck or the BVG 2015 generation tables play a role.
The calculations are based on the following actuarial assumptions for the respective reference dates:

Organisational structure
Irrespective of its corporate structure, the msg life Group is divided up into business units assigned to market sectors or markets. This responsibility encom- passes both the further development of the respec- tive solution portfolio and the handling of customer projects, and is assumed at divisional level. The heads of these divisions and the managing directors comprise the next senior management level below the msg life ag Management Board.
In September 2021, pursuant to Section 52 (2) of the German Limited Liability Companies Act (GmbHG), the shareholders’ meeting of msg life central europe gmbh passed a resolution setting a target of (at least) 0% for the proportion of women on the Supervisory Board of msg life central europe gmbh and among the managing directors of msg life central europe gmbh by 31 Decem- ber 2025. The shareholders’ meeting is of the opinion that personal qualifications and ability, not gender, should be the decisive factor with regard to filling po- sitions on the Supervisory Board and among the man- aging directors. As such, no considerations that are not solely based on the candidate’s personal and profes- sional suitability for a role should be decisive.

///Retrieved document 2: Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial calculations carried out using the projected unit credit method and with consider- ation for the 2018 G mortality tables from Professor Heubeck or the BVG 2015 gen- eration tables. The provisions for pensions and other obligations are discounted at the average market interest rate for the preceding ten years published by the German Central Bank for an assumed remaining term of 15 years.
Tax provisions have been set up to the amount of the anticipated tax burden (the settlement amount).
The other provisions are valued at the settlement amount allowing for all discernible risks, expected risks and anticipated increases in prices and costs. Provisions with terms exceeding one year are subject to the deduction of an average market rate of interest for the last seven years that is appropriate for the term of each provision as determined by the German Central Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank). The provision for severance payments is measured using the projected unit credit method. An actuarial interest rate of 1.1 per cent p.a. (previous year: 1.6 per cent p.a.) and a salary increase rate of 2.5 per cent p.a. (previous year: 1.45 per cent p.a.) were used in the calculation on each key date.
Liabilities are valued at the settlement amount on the statement of financial position date.
Advance payments received on account of orders are recognised at their net value. The company has made use of the option provided by section 268, paragraph 5, sen- tence 2, of the HGB to openly deduct payments received on account of inventories from the line item ‘Inventories’ on the assets side.
Income received prior to the reporting date is recognised under accruals and deferrals as long as it represents revenue for a specific time after the reporting date.
The deferred taxes are calculated in line with the temporary concept. According to the temporary concept, deferred taxes are formed for all temporary and virtually per- manent accounting and measurement differences between the values of assets and liabilities recognised under commercial and tax law.
When the deferred tax assets are determined, deferred tax assets on losses carried forward must be taken into account in the amount of the offset of losses that is to be expected within the next five years. Accordingly, no deferred tax assets were rec- ognised for tax losses on 31 December 2021, taking their realisability into account.

///Retrieved document 1: VI. Notes to the consolidated cash flow statement
The cash flow statement displays the origin and use of payment flows in the 2021 and 2020 financial years. Here, payment flows from operating activities and from in- vestment and financial activities are differentiated. The cash and cash equivalents encompass all cash in hand, bank balances and cash equivalents with a maximum term of three months as at the date of acquisition. There are no access restrictions on cash and cash equivalents.
Changes in cash and cash equivalents from operating activities are adjusted for ef- fects from currency conversion.
Changes in cash and cash equivalents from investment and financial activities are calculated in terms of sums paid.
Changes in cash and cash equivalents from continuing activities are, in contrast, indi- rectly derived from earnings before taxes.
The main non-cash effects in the cash flow from operating activities were: deprecia- tion of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounting to 2.809 mil- lion euros (previous year: 3.497 million euros) as well as the increase and decrease in provisions of -2.271 million euros (previous year: 5.405 million euros).

///Retrieved document 2: Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial calculations carried out using the projected unit credit method and with consider- ation for the 2018 G mortality tables from Professor Heubeck or the BVG 2015 gen- eration tables. The provisions for pensions and other obligations are discounted at the average market interest rate for the preceding ten years published by the German Central Bank for an assumed remaining term of 15 years.
Tax provisions have been set up to the amount of the anticipated tax burden (the settlement amount).
The other provisions are valued at the settlement amount allowing for all discernible risks, expected risks and anticipated increases in prices and costs. Provisions with terms exceeding one year are subject to the deduction of an average market rate of interest for the last seven years that is appropriate for the term of each provision as determined by the German Central Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank). The provision for severance payments is measured using the projected unit credit method. An actuarial interest rate of 1.1 per cent p.a. (previous year: 1.6 per cent p.a.) and a salary increase rate of 2.5 per cent p.a. (previous year: 1.45 per cent p.a.) were used in the calculation on each key date.
Liabilities are valued at the settlement amount on the statement of financial position date.
Advance payments received on account of orders are recognised at their net value. The company has made use of the option provided by section 268, paragraph 5, sen- tence 2, of the HGB to openly deduct payments received on account of inventories from the line item ‘Inventories’ on the assets side.
Income received prior to the reporting date is recognised under accruals and deferrals as long as it represents revenue for a specific time after the reporting date.
The deferred taxes are calculated in line with the temporary concept. According to the temporary concept, deferred taxes are formed for all temporary and virtually per- manent accounting and measurement differences between the values of assets and liabilities recognised under commercial and tax law.
When the deferred tax assets are determined, deferred tax assets on losses carried forward must be taken into account in the amount of the offset of losses that is to be expected within the next five years. Accordingly, no deferred tax assets were rec- ognised for tax losses on 31 December 2021, taking their realisability into account.

2. Consolidation principles
Capital is consolidated according to the purchase method of accounting.
Any difference remaining on the assets side after netting is recognised as goodwill on the assets side and amortised over its conventional useful life of five years.
There is no more goodwill to recognise in the 2021 financial year, following the decon- solidation of the shares in spheos GmbH & Co. KG, Munich, and spheos Verwaltungs GmbH, Munich, in the previous year.
Receivables and payables are offset in the consolidated financial statements by elim- inating the receivables and the corresponding payables between the companies in- cluded in the consolidated financial statements.

IV. Notes on the statement of financial position
1. Fixed assets
The development of fixed assets in the financial year and in the previous year, in- cluding their breakdown, is presented separately in the consolidated statement of changes in fixed assets (see Appendix to the notes).
The intangible assets are essentially software purchased from third parties.

///Retrieved document 2: msg life AG and the msg Group company msg nexinsure ag, Ismaning, have been working closely together for many years in the context of the joint solution msg.Insur- ance Suite. The two companies are now moving even closer together and have had a joint management team with unified responsibilities since 1 February 2021. Addition- ally, msg life and msg nexinsure have been sharing the new co-brand msg insur:it in the insurance market since December 2021, underlining their leading role as a pro- vider of insurance products. Besides the new co-brand msg insur:it, msg life and msg nexinsure will remain independent legal units.
II. General accounting and valuation methods
The annual financial statements of the subsidiaries included in the consolidated fi- nancial statements and of the parent company are prepared according to the follow- ing accounting and valuation methods and in compliance with the statutory require- ments:
Intangible assets acquired for valuable consideration are valued at original cost less depreciation according to the straight-line method, with a useful life of between three and 15 years. If it is likely to be permanently impaired, it is written down. The goodwill was already fully amortised as at 31 December 2021.
The company has opted not to recognise internally generated intangible fixed assets pursuant to section 248, paragraph 2, sentence 1, of the HGB.
Fixed assets are carried at original cost, less regular linear depreciation in the case of depreciable assets. The useful lives are between three and ten years. Depreciable movable fixed assets that can be used independently and whose (net) costs per indi- vidual item exceed 250 euros, but not 800 euros, qualify as low-value assets and are immediately recognised as expenses in the year of acquisition.
Assets with a cost of less than 250 euros are recognised as expenses.
Inventories are measured at historical cost. Apart from the unit costs, the costs of production also include an appropriate proportion of the overhead costs and write- downs. The loss-free valuation rule is observed. Work contracts which extend across multiple financial years are treated as work in progress until the milestone is deliv- ered, fully or in part, to the customer. Advance payments received on account of or- ders are written off openly from inventories.

The disposal in the financial assets concerns an interest in ARGE FJA KR BU-System, Munich, which has not been consolidated. The msg life Group had few means of par- ticipating in the financial and business decision-making processes of the company and as such has no significant influence over the company.
2.
Inventories
Inventories predominantly include as-yet-uninvoiced sales relating to customer or- ders. The amount stated includes some fixed-price projects, which have been capital- ised while observing the loss-free valuation rule.
Payments on account of unfinished purchased services totalling 28.300 million euros (previous year: 23.105 million euros) are attributable to a major project received in 2018 and have been paid to msg systems ag, Ismaning. These payments made on account are offset by payments totalling 28.888 million euros (previous year: 23.105 million euros) received on account from customers.
Payments received on account of orders totalling 54.730 million euros (previous year: 59.164 million euros) have been offset in full against inventories. This leaves net in- ventories of 7.541 million euros (previous year: 4.324 million euros).
3. Trade receivables
Trade receivables totalled 38.295 million euros as at 31 December 2021 (previous year: 34.722 million euros). Of this, 38.198 million euros (previous year: 34.576 mil- lion euros) are due within one year and 97,000 euros are due within five years.
4. Accounts due from affiliated companies
As in the previous year, the accounts due from affiliated companies of 3.504 million euros as at 31 December 2021 (previous year: 178,000 euros) were due within one year. This increase is due to the continuous expansion of the collaboration between msg life and the msg Group company msg nexinsure.

Besides the new co-brand msg insur:it, msg life and msg nexinsure will remain independent legal units.
II. General accounting and valuation methods
The annual financial statements of the subsidiaries included in the consolidated fi- nancial statements and of the parent company are prepared according to the follow- ing accounting and valuation methods and in compliance with the statutory require- ments:
Intangible assets acquired for valuable consideration are valued at original cost less depreciation according to the straight-line method, with a useful life of between three and 15 years. If it is likely to be permanently impaired, it is written down. The goodwill was already fully amortised as at 31 December 2021.
The company has opted not to recognise internally generated intangible fixed assets pursuant to section 248, paragraph 2, sentence 1, of the HGB.
Fixed assets are carried at original cost, less regular linear depreciation in the case of depreciable assets. The useful lives are between three and ten years. Depreciable movable fixed assets that can be used independently and whose (net) costs per indi- vidual item exceed 250 euros, but not 800 euros, qualify as low-value assets and are immediately recognised as expenses in the year of acquisition.
Assets with a cost of less than 250 euros are recognised as expenses.
Inventories are measured at historical cost. Apart from the unit costs, the costs of production also include an appropriate proportion of the overhead costs and write- downs. The loss-free valuation rule is observed. Work contracts which extend across multiple financial years are treated as work in progress until the milestone is deliv- ered, fully or in part, to the customer. Advance payments received on account of or- ders are written off openly from inventories.

1,The joint solution that msg life AG and msg nexinsure ag have been working on is the msg Insurance Suite.,"///Retrieved document 0: With more than 1,200 employees at sites in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Slovakia, Slove- nia, Portugal, Spain and the United States, msg life is very well positioned in the field of software and consult- ing services for insurance companies and pension fund institutions. msg life’s wide range of digitised products and services for life insurance companies in Europe and, in particular, health and group insurance companies in the United States, gives it excellent market opportuni- ties and a promising competitive position.
In connection with its ongoing internationalisation strategy, msg life and IBM have entered into a partner- ship to open up new insurance markets. The goal is to significantly increase the competitiveness of interna- tional insurance companies through a fully digitised end-to-end solution, thereby securing their future.
In the past, the strategic presence of msg life in each foreign market was an important success factor when it came to attracting new customers. It is also becoming more and more apparent that Group companies want to put the solutions implemented for one region at the disposal of other Group companies in other countries – which can advance the ongoing internationalisation of msg life as a service provider for its customers. Besides the established partnership with IBM, the objective in the 2022 financial year is to press ahead with ma- jor sales projects, especially in the established foreign markets, as in the 2021 financial year.
The Benelux countries are an important market in this regard, where msg life, in cooperation with IBM, gained its largest new customer so far in AEGON in the Nether- lands, and is now working on the related introductory project.
The Austrian market is also a cornerstone of msg life’s international activities: msg life has enjoyed a number of highly significant successes there in recent years. The placement and further development of the consulting portfolio for the German-language markets and the mar- keting of msg life products in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is carried out from Vienna. On the Swiss market, too, msg life sees good prospects for the further expansion of its business and is represent- ed with its own offices and by various well-known life insurers such as AXA and Schweizerische Mobiliar. An innovative, AI-based and previously unique migration solution developed by msg life will be used at AXA in 2023 in the context of the acquisition of the legacy port- folio.

With regard to the US market, msg life is currently exam- ining whether it would be possible to deploy a localised version of its portfolio of European life insurance prod- ucts in connection with its specific US products as an integrated solution. Overall, msg life continues to enjoy steady growth in the various insurance sectors in the US market and intends to exploit the potential for business that this represents. In addition to the implementation and integration of specific software products, the range of services offered by msg life encompasses a variety of consulting services in connection with product and tar- iff modelling, for example, as well as operator models – these are generating growing interest in the market.
The target group of the msg life Group company there is predominantly health and group insurers and, in fu- ture, will also include life insurers on the basis of the US product portfolio. The expansion and diversification of the company’s own range of solutions and partner- ships with specialised service providers are being used to unlock new customer groups. Now that the Biden ad- ministration has built on the Patient Protection and Af- fordable Care Act, msg life expects the state healthcare programmes such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid to grow further with the sales opportu- nities this provides. In the US market, msg life is also examining the potential for a commercial partnership in the field of health insurance.
Following an excellent 2021 financial year, msg life is registering a high level of demand for solutions in the first quarter of the current 2022 financial year – from insurance companies in Germany and other countries in equal measure. In this context, msg life also expects to see further regulation throughout the financial ser- vices sector. Be it the revision of Solvency II, the new international accounting standard IFRS 17, the Europe- an Transparency Directive, the rollout of a digital pen- sion overview or the introduction of PEPP, the ongoing implementation of numerous regulatory requirements necessitates comprehensive changes to the solutions which are currently used and ties up vast amounts of insurers’ resources. This means that the use of versatile, cost-effective standard software remains highly attrac- tive throughout the insurance industry.

///Retrieved document 2: The msg life Group does not conduct open-ended re- search, but instead focuses on purely target-oriented research. Special importance is attached to close com- munication with the market and customers as their as- sessment of the products’ relevance to business success is crucial. The msg life Group therefore attaches a great deal of importance to its cooperation with customers in the user and operator groups as well as with partners (IBM or the msg Group, for example) in relation to its most important products. The approaches devised with-
in the framework of research are presented, discussed and evaluated within the user and operator groups at an early stage and, if required, on a cross-product basis. The evaluation is conducted with particular regard to users’ interest in acquiring the product enhancements. In this way, new releases of standard software products are generally partially financed by advance orders from some of the customers.
As there are no user groups that can be accessed for the placement of new products or the opening up of new markets, early customer models are used which reward a customer’s early decision in favour of a new product with commercial benefits.
Purchasing R & D expertise
In its capacity as market leader in its core business, the msg life Group is usually unable to have recourse to ready-made external research findings. This particularly applies to specialist thematic areas in the customers’ sectors. As a sector-specific service provider, the com-
T N E M E G A N A M

pany prefers to rely on its own research, which builds upon its participation in trade conferences, association activities and joint projects with partner companies. Fu- ture trends, too, can usually be identified more reliably on the basis of the systematic reviewing of customer requirements from projects and canvassing situations than on the basis of external surveys. It goes without saying that the qualification level of the Group’s em- ployees is updated continuously by means of selective (also external) ongoing training activities. In the tech- nology sector, msg life makes use of rapidly develop- ing standards and non-proprietary technologies right
through to freely available open-source products. The company also safeguards the quality of its own techno- logical orientation by maintaining close partnerships with IBM and with selected colleges and universities.
R & D expenditure
The msg life Group’s R & D expenditure totalled 11.195 million euros in the 2021 financial year (previous year: 8.934 million euros). Once again, no development ex- penses were capitalised.

It compared actual business performance against its targets at each meeting and scrutinised the operational and strategic performance of the company in detail.

The Group’s assets position
ASSET STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
The 2021 financial year was above expectations. This development was caused by numerous sales successes with the corresponding licence income, stable business with existing customers and lower travel costs due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Management Board of msg life ag expects the earnings, financial and assets posi- tion of the company this year to remain at the same lev- el as in the previous year.

At 44.5 million euros (previous year: 59.5 million euros), procured services represented a large proportion of to- tal costs. The significant decrease in procured services of 15.2 million euros in the 2021 financial year is due to other services which contain expenses of 9.2 million eu- ros (previous year: 25.4 million euros) resulting from the successful delivery of a milestone within the framework of a major project in cooperation with msg systems ag.

PRINCIPLES AND GOALS OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
Procured services include external freelance staff whose costs amounted to 12.2 million euros in the 2021 finan- cial year (previous year: 10.7 million euros). Procured services cover special requirements such as capacity utilisation peaks due to new projects and, as such, they are a variable element in the total costs.

Other operating expenses accounted for 11.4 per cent of total costs in 2021, an increase compared with the previous year (10.1 per cent), and came to 19.4 million euros (pre- vious year: 18.6 million euros). As in the previous year, the main component of other operating expenses is rent for office space of 7.0 million euros (primarily renting).
Over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, travel ex- penses associated with products decreased further and were just 0.4 million euros in the 2021 financial year (previous year: 0.9 million euros). Communication costs decreased slightly, falling by 0.1 million euros from 0.9 million euros to 0.8 million euros.

Despite persistently difficult general conditions, private life insurance cover remains indispensable in Germany in view of the demographic trend and the necessity of covering against biometric risks. In the process, almost all insurers are striving to enhance their existing pro- duct ranges and develop new, innovative ones – this goes for all existing product groups, control layers and legal forms. The companies’ starting situations and the pressure on them to innovate vary and are consequent- ly bringing about a variety of innovations. The focus is on products that tick more than one box at the same time: products that satisfy the desire of the policyhold- ers for security, returns and flexibility, meet the needs of the insurer in terms of more efficiency and profitabil- ity and comply with the regulatory requirements at the same time.
In terms of the conventional capital accumulation pro- ducts, modifications of the guarantees are dominant, for example through the use of current calculation guidelines or by dispensing with the annual interest guarantee. With the biometric products, too, there is a great deal of action on the market. Dynamic hybrid products have become the standard now and there is a continuous flow of innovative products in addition to them which allow, for example, investment in funds, but also the purchasing of options on the basis of tra- ditional basic cover. Insurance companies at the larger end of the scale in particular are offering products for old-age provision with capital guarantees on the basis of unit-linked approaches with investment guarantees.

///Retrieved document 1: Given the current challenges, microservice-oriented ar- chitectures designed to quickly support modified busi- ness models and high system versatility for the rapid in- troduction of innovative products are factors crucial to the success of insurance companies. The developments in insurance products described above are typically not associated with particular product families. The plat- form economy is also playing a key role in the insurance industry this year: numerous insurers are now using platforms and ecosystems to provide digital products and services beyond what had previously been their core business – this in turn is opening up new ways to create value.
For larger insurance companies, the acquisition of closed insurance contract portfolios that are no lon- ger available for sale (‘run-off’ portfolios) from mainly smaller insurance companies remains an important fac- tor. This enables the latter to generate positive effects for their books, and buyers can generate significant economies of scale and cost synergies. Modern asset management with modern and powerful IT systems plays a decisive role in this regard as well in the more efficient management of contracts.
The digitisation of our economy and society has been accelerated greatly by the Covid-19 pandemic and re- mains one of the most significant challenges facing the German insurance industry. Digitised business pro- cesses enable the ever-greater integration of systems across divisions, segments and company boundaries. That makes it possible to exploit the potential repre- sented by the standardisation and automation of pro- cesses to a greater extent. Fully automated processes lead to enormous gains with regard to efficiency as well as significantly lower costs. The subjects of customer centricity and individualisation, industrialisation and automation, analytics and data effectiveness, and stan- dardisation and integration are at the heart of the digi- tisation trend. Insurers are increasingly committed to cloud solutions with which IT capacities can be adapted to meet the level of demand in a flexible manner.
With digitisation, modern insurance products and ser- vices can be made available on new channels or inte- grated into new sales and cooperation platforms; all of this requires extensive changes to the IT landscapes of insurers in order for the new technology and platforms to be integrated and is taken into account by msg life when it develops its products and services. The compa- ny already has SaaS and cloud-based solutions to sup- port its customers with the digitisation process, thanks in no small part to its strategic collaboration with IBM.

///Retrieved document 2: Likewise, insurers in the USA have survived the crisis rel- atively well. This is the conclusion of the article entitled ‘Der Versicherungsmarkt USA im Blick’ (‘A look at the US insurance market’) published by the R&D service pro- vider Versicherungsforen Leipzig in December 2021. It states that gross premiums grew by 0.6 per cent overall in 2020. Although growth of 1.2 per cent was achieved in the non-life segment, life premiums decreased by 1.4 per cent. With gross premiums of 2.5 billion dollars, the US insurance industry is a global market leader: the USA accounts for more than 40 per cent of the global market.
Development of business
In the German-speaking market, the msg life Group is the market leader with the services and products it of- fers for life insurers and pension fund institutions and more than half of all leading life insurers in these coun- tries are its customers. The Group’s research and devel- opment activities are aimed at continuously reinforcing its leading position. With the regulatory requirements still changing constantly and the increasingly dynamic variety of products, insurance companies are increas- ingly pursuing a strategy of replacing their previous in- house software solutions with standard software.
msg life’s products and consulting services are now a fixed part of the msg Group’s portfolio for the insurance industry. And as an associated company in the msg Group, msg life is an even more significant strategic partner for its customers and an even more attractive employer for the employees.
Insurers’ expenses on IT also reflect the relevance of digitisation: according to the GDV, the insurance in- dustry invested around 5.6 billion euros in its IT in the 2020 financial year, compared to around 5.5 billion eu- ros in 2019. At 2.55 per cent, the IT cost ratio (the ratio of IT expenses to companies’ gross premium income) remained almost constant. According to the GDV publi-
In the TRAIL.X (TRustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Life Insurance) project that was launched in 2021, msg life and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich are de- veloping deep neural networks (DNNs) for the actuarial computation module.

In particular, this effect is due to a project being carried out in coopera- tion with msg systems ag in which the gross revenue was 15.2 million euros lower than in the previous year.
As at the balance sheet date, there were no changes to the consolidation group described in the consolidated financial statements for the 2020 financial year as at 31 December 2020.

makes up 77.5 per cent (previous year: 75.6 per cent) of total turnover. Product-based turnover overall was down by 2.2 million euros to 43.6 million euros (previ- ous year: 45.8 million euros). In terms of product-based turnover, licensing income came to 14.1 million euros in the reporting period (previous year: 18.7 million euros), which represents 7.3 per cent of total turnover (previous year: 10.0 per cent). Maintenance turnover came to 23.6 million euros in 2021 (previous year: 21.0 million euros) and therefore makes up 12.2 per cent of the total turn- over (previous year: 11.2 per cent).
The other turnover largely comprised computing centre services in 2021. This figure remained nearly constant in the past financial year at 5.9 million euros (previous year: 6.1 million euros).
As for the regional breakdown of turnover, the aggre- gate figure for Germany in the 2021 financial year to- talled 172.2 million euros (previous year: 159.3 million euros) and 21.6 million euros in other countries (previ- ous year: 28.2 million euros).

Summarised evaluation of the company’s business situation
The 2021 financial year was another strong year for the msg life Group. Numerous sales successes with the cor- responding licence income, the very stable business with existing customers and continually low travel costs due to the still-ongoing coronavirus pandemic resulted in the targets set at the beginning of the financial year with regard to the financial key performance indicators of Group revenue from its own business (HGB) and Group earnings (HGB) being exceeded.
In the reporting period, the msg life Group recorded gross Group revenue from its own business under Ger- man GAAP of 176.1 million euros and Group earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) under German GAAP of 17.9 million euros.
The business situation of the company in the 2021 re- porting year can be described as positive overall. The foundations exist for positive development in 2022 and beyond. Last year’s prognosis in the separate financial statements forecast positive net results for the year; as the holding company, the individual Group company finished the 2021 financial year with net profit of 10.8 million euros.

With regard to the US market, msg life is currently exam- ining whether it would be possible to deploy a localised version of its portfolio of European life insurance prod- ucts in connection with its specific US products as an integrated solution. Overall, msg life continues to enjoy steady growth in the various insurance sectors in the US market and intends to exploit the potential for business that this represents. In addition to the implementation and integration of specific software products, the range of services offered by msg life encompasses a variety of consulting services in connection with product and tar- iff modelling, for example, as well as operator models – these are generating growing interest in the market.
The target group of the msg life Group company there is predominantly health and group insurers and, in fu- ture, will also include life insurers on the basis of the US product portfolio. The expansion and diversification of the company’s own range of solutions and partner- ships with specialised service providers are being used to unlock new customer groups. Now that the Biden ad- ministration has built on the Patient Protection and Af- fordable Care Act, msg life expects the state healthcare programmes such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid to grow further with the sales opportu- nities this provides.

Following an excellent 2021 financial year, msg life is registering a high level of demand for solutions in the first quarter of the current 2022 financial year – from insurance companies in Germany and other countries in equal measure. In this context, msg life also expects to see further regulation throughout the financial ser- vices sector. Be it the revision of Solvency II, the new international accounting standard IFRS 17, the Europe- an Transparency Directive, the rollout of a digital pen- sion overview or the introduction of PEPP, the ongoing implementation of numerous regulatory requirements necessitates comprehensive changes to the solutions which are currently used and ties up vast amounts of insurers’ resources. This means that the use of versatile, cost-effective standard software remains highly attrac- tive throughout the insurance industry.

Development of business
In the German-speaking market, the msg life Group is the market leader with the services and products it of- fers for life insurers and pension fund institutions and more than half of all leading life insurers in these coun- tries are its customers. The Group’s research and devel- opment activities are aimed at continuously reinforcing its leading position. With the regulatory requirements still changing constantly and the increasingly dynamic variety of products, insurance companies are increas- ingly pursuing a strategy of replacing their previous in- house software solutions with standard software.
msg life’s products and consulting services are now a fixed part of the msg Group’s portfolio for the insurance industry. And as an associated company in the msg Group, msg life is an even more significant strategic partner for its customers and an even more attractive employer for the employees.

///Retrieved document 1: Finally, the launch of a voluntary Pan-European Pen- sion Product (PEPP) has been decided on a European level. The regulatory technical standards were defined in March 2021. PEPP is to be available throughout Eu- rope, although providers will have to meet strict criteria before they are permitted to offer it. The European pen- sion is designed to be complementary to existing state, statutory and occupational pension systems. Potential providers of the pension include insurance companies, company pension funds, banks and administrators of alternative investment funds.
Digitisation also remains at the top of the agenda for the German insurance industry. In particular, digitisa- tion has been accelerated greatly by the Covid-19 crisis. Digitised business processes enable the ever-greater integration of systems across divisions, segments and company boundaries. That makes it possible to exploit the potential represented by the standardisation and automation of processes to a greater extent. Fully auto- mated processes lead to enormous gains with regard to efficiency as well as significantly lower costs.
In Europe, the insurance industry largely managed to remain on track in 2020, the first year of the pandemic, according to the European Insurance Study 2021 pub- lished by Zeb Consulting in December 2021. Although insurers did have to accept larger drops in profits and premiums in some cases, the industry was in good over- all condition when it was hit by the crisis, enabling it to mostly remain profitable. Even the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) describes the European insurance industry as ‘fundamentally ro- bust’. This is demonstrated by the results of the stress test 2021 that were published in December 2021. The test included 43 major European insurance groups, in- cluding five from Germany.

///Retrieved document 2: Given the current challenges, microservice-oriented ar- chitectures designed to quickly support modified busi- ness models and high system versatility for the rapid in- troduction of innovative products are factors crucial to the success of insurance companies. The developments in insurance products described above are typically not associated with particular product families. The plat- form economy is also playing a key role in the insurance industry this year: numerous insurers are now using platforms and ecosystems to provide digital products and services beyond what had previously been their core business – this in turn is opening up new ways to create value.
For larger insurance companies, the acquisition of closed insurance contract portfolios that are no lon- ger available for sale (‘run-off’ portfolios) from mainly smaller insurance companies remains an important fac- tor. This enables the latter to generate positive effects for their books, and buyers can generate significant economies of scale and cost synergies. Modern asset management with modern and powerful IT systems plays a decisive role in this regard as well in the more efficient management of contracts.
The digitisation of our economy and society has been accelerated greatly by the Covid-19 pandemic and re- mains one of the most significant challenges facing the German insurance industry. Digitised business pro- cesses enable the ever-greater integration of systems across divisions, segments and company boundaries. That makes it possible to exploit the potential repre- sented by the standardisation and automation of pro- cesses to a greater extent. Fully automated processes lead to enormous gains with regard to efficiency as well as significantly lower costs. The subjects of customer centricity and individualisation, industrialisation and automation, analytics and data effectiveness, and stan- dardisation and integration are at the heart of the digi- tisation trend. Insurers are increasingly committed to cloud solutions with which IT capacities can be adapted to meet the level of demand in a flexible manner.
With digitisation, modern insurance products and ser- vices can be made available on new channels or inte- grated into new sales and cooperation platforms; all of this requires extensive changes to the IT landscapes of insurers in order for the new technology and platforms to be integrated and is taken into account by msg life when it develops its products and services. The compa- ny already has SaaS and cloud-based solutions to sup- port its customers with the digitisation process, thanks in no small part to its strategic collaboration with IBM.

which applicants are asked individual interview ques- tions in videos and are able to respond with their own recorded answers.
For the company, the 2021 financial year was again overshadowed by the restrictions on working in offices and on customers’ premises due to the pandemic, as well as the extremely high percentage of employees who worked from home. As the company was able to master this decentralised way of working largely with- out issue in the second year of the pandemic, it has laid a robust cornerstone for the future of work organisation at msg life. The company took the various services it of- fers to support employees and their families further in 2021, and made further improvements to this field with a service provider and its extensive range of options and services.
The onboarding process for new employees was almost exclusively remote and digitised in 2021. msg life has been holding welcome and introductory events for all new employees for years. In the course of these on- boarding sessions, the strategic orientation of the com- pany is presented, as well as its targets in each field of business. The aim is also to give the new colleagues a broad network within the entire company as quickly as possible. In 2021, msg life took on the challenge of sup- porting new employees with a structured onboarding scheme. Innovative online collaboration formats, which are now well established, advanced and more profes- sional, were used for these purposes.
In order to find new employees, the company offers re- cruitment opportunities in various job profiles and at various career levels. msg life uses the networks and expertise of employees within the sector; a recommen- dation programme has been established and will be expanded. In addition to its own networks, the Internet remains the most important medium for achieving the company’s recruitment success. msg life thus places emphasis on using relevant online channels, far-reach- ing platforms as well as niche job markets, and im- plements its strategies in the fields of search engine optimisation and search engine advertising by using target-group-specific landing pages.

Strategic opportunities
msg life regards the continuation of regulation through- out the insurance sector as a direct consequence of the financial crisis. Like the ongoing low-interest phase, this regulation is necessitating a great deal of adapta- tion with regard to the solutions currently used in the insurance sector and is reinforcing the trend towards the use of standard software and cross-sector platform solutions – such as those offered by msg life. At this time, the situation in the insurance market is proving to be an opportunity for the company, as demonstrated by the new contracts over the past few years and current sales projects.
In the past, the Group company FJA-US, Inc. profited from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) which was enacted in 2013 in terms of both turnover and earnings. After the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act suffered from a lack of support from the Trump administration, the Biden administra- tion pressed on with an improvement to the Patient Pro- tection and Affordable Care Act in late 2021 in the form of the Build Back Better Act. As a result, state healthcare programmes such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid can be expected to grow further. Thanks to its now well-established partnerships with leading providers such as Companion Data Services, the msg life Group company in the USA can offer end-to-end ser- vices including claims handling. Additionally, the com- pany successfully expanded its related activities in the health and group insurance market and further diversi- fied its range of services.

With regard to the US market, msg life is currently exam- ining whether it would be possible to deploy a localised version of its portfolio of European life insurance prod- ucts in connection with its specific US products as an integrated solution. Overall, msg life continues to enjoy steady growth in the various insurance sectors in the US market and intends to exploit the potential for business that this represents. In addition to the implementation and integration of specific software products, the range of services offered by msg life encompasses a variety of consulting services in connection with product and tar- iff modelling, for example, as well as operator models – these are generating growing interest in the market.
The target group of the msg life Group company there is predominantly health and group insurers and, in fu- ture, will also include life insurers on the basis of the US product portfolio. The expansion and diversification of the company’s own range of solutions and partner- ships with specialised service providers are being used to unlock new customer groups. Now that the Biden ad- ministration has built on the Patient Protection and Af- fordable Care Act, msg life expects the state healthcare programmes such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid to grow further with the sales opportu- nities this provides. In the US market, msg life is also examining the potential for a commercial partnership in the field of health insurance.
Following an excellent 2021 financial year, msg life is registering a high level of demand for solutions in the first quarter of the current 2022 financial year – from insurance companies in Germany and other countries in equal measure. In this context, msg life also expects to see further regulation throughout the financial ser- vices sector. Be it the revision of Solvency II, the new international accounting standard IFRS 17, the Europe- an Transparency Directive, the rollout of a digital pen- sion overview or the introduction of PEPP, the ongoing implementation of numerous regulatory requirements necessitates comprehensive changes to the solutions which are currently used and ties up vast amounts of insurers’ resources. This means that the use of versatile, cost-effective standard software remains highly attrac- tive throughout the insurance industry.

In connection with its ongoing internationalisation strategy, msg life and IBM have entered into a partner- ship to open up new insurance markets. The goal is to significantly increase the competitiveness of interna- tional insurance companies through a fully digitised end-to-end solution, thereby securing their future.
In the past, the strategic presence of msg life in each foreign market was an important success factor when it came to attracting new customers. It is also becoming more and more apparent that Group companies want to put the solutions implemented for one region at the disposal of other Group companies in other countries – which can advance the ongoing internationalisation of msg life as a service provider for its customers. Besides the established partnership with IBM, the objective in the 2022 financial year is to press ahead with ma- jor sales projects, especially in the established foreign markets, as in the 2021 financial year.
The Benelux countries are an important market in this regard, where msg life, in cooperation with IBM, gained its largest new customer so far in AEGON in the Nether- lands, and is now working on the related introductory project.
The Austrian market is also a cornerstone of msg life’s international activities: msg life has enjoyed a number of highly significant successes there in recent years. The placement and further development of the consulting portfolio for the German-language markets and the mar- keting of msg life products in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is carried out from Vienna. On the Swiss market, too, msg life sees good prospects for the further expansion of its business and is represent- ed with its own offices and by various well-known life insurers such as AXA and Schweizerische Mobiliar. An innovative, AI-based and previously unique migration solution developed by msg life will be used at AXA in 2023 in the context of the acquisition of the legacy port- folio.

Shareholders’ rights and duties
Shareholders have property and administrative rights. The property rights include, in particular, the right to participate in profits (section 58, paragraph 4, of the German Stock Corporation Act – AktG) and liquidation proceeds (section 271 of the AktG), as well as pre-emp- tion rights to shares in the event of capital increases (section 186 of the AktG).
The administrative rights include the right to attend the annual general meeting and speak, ask questions, put forward motions and exercise voting rights. Sharehold- ers can assert these rights by initiating, in particular, actions for information and rescission.
Each share guarantees one vote at the annual general meeting. The annual general meeting elects the mem- bers of the Supervisory Board and the auditor of the financial statements; it decides, in particular, on the formal approval of the actions of the members of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board, alter- ations to the articles of incorporation, corporate action, empowerment to acquire treasury shares and, if re- quired, the conducting of a special audit, the premature dismissal of members of the Supervisory Board and a dissolution of the company.

In order to provide protec- tion against penetration by viruses, the latest software available on the market is deployed as a matter of prin- ciple.

Risks from takeovers
Competition risks
With its solutions, msg life is a leading sector-based service provider for life insurers and pension funds in Europe and in particular for health and group insurers in the United States. This has led to a concentration and therefore an increase in market development risks. At the same time, this increases the company’s profitabil- ity. msg life will therefore attempt to persevere with its existing strategy, including in its current product seg- ments and regional markets, and to cover entire value chains and product ranges with its solutions. In this way, it hopes to achieve a decisive competitive advantage on the market, particularly vis-à-vis new competitors with aggressive pricing policies.
msg life is currently interested in expanding its market position in German-speaking countries and internation- ally, primarily through organic growth. This can also be supported in parallel by strategic acquisitions. The suc- cess of an acquisition is dependent upon whether the acquired company can be successfully integrated in the Group structure and the desired synergy effects can be generated.

Opportunity and risk report
General
All the following estimations regarding opportunities and risks were made on the reporting date, 31 Decem- ber 2021.
In the type of business it conducts, the msg life Group is exposed to a large number of uncertainties which, if realised, can affect the Group’s earnings, financial and assets position, and that of the company, either posi- tively or negatively, or result in msg life falling short of or exceeding the targets it has set itself for the future development of its business.
pliance management were incorporated into the early risk detection system. The corresponding risk report for 2021 was presented to the Supervisory Board in Febru- ary 2022.
In 2021, the msg life Group’s profile did not change sig- nificantly with regard to the main types of opportunity and risk areas to which it is exposed. Below, individual types of risk that are identified as being important are explained in greater detail. The specification of these risks does not imply that other risks which have not been mentioned will not have a significant impact on msg life’s earnings, financial and assets position.
Among the Management Board’s most important tasks in the overall management of the Group are, in close coordination with the Supervisory Board, laying down general conditions and processes of risk management for the msg life Group, monitoring the degree of com- pliance with them and, in conjunction with the heads of the operating units and the administrative departments, regularly analysing the development of risks in the re- spective segments.
The msg life Group’s risk management system is docu- mented in a risk manual. One employee in the holding company’s Organisation & IT Services division has been appointed risk manager of the Group and is thereby en- trusted with submitting the prevailing risk management system to regular internal evaluation and documenting this process. It is the responsibility of the managers of the individual divisions to continuously monitor and deal with the risks to which their own divisions are ex- posed.
The foundation of good risk management is the reliable and prompt provision of the management with relevant information about the course of business. For this pur- pose, msg life has set up a monthly controlling and re- porting system.

This means that losses from both borrowing capital at exces- sive interest rates as well as investing surplus funds at interest rates below the market level should be avoided.
Credit risks (default risks):
Credit risk arises from deteriorating economic circum- stances of the company’s debtors or counterparties. Firstly, this results in a risk of partial or complete default on contractually agreed payments and, secondly, in a reduction in the value of financial instruments due to a poorer credit rating.
Credit risk management is responsible for the opera- tional measurement and management of credit risks. Its functions include, in particular, monitoring credit risk positions and exposure and analysis of credit ratings.
Because of the company’s current holdings of cash and cash equivalents, msg life ag considers the liquidity risk to be low at present. The msg life Group has sufficient liquid funds to enable it to service its financial liabili- ties.
As at the balance sheet date, the company had loan agreements with three banks totalling 7.500 million eu- ros. As at the reporting date, the loans had been used in the amount of 1.560 million euros for security deposits.
Risk reporting in respect of the use of financial instruments
Objective and methods of financial risk management:
Financial risk management is designed to put the msg life Group in a position to recognise all the significant risks to which it is potentially exposed at an early stage and to take appropriate countermeasures.

According to Branchenkompass Insurance 2021, the replacement of legacy systems with cloud computing IT is considered a recurring theme in the industry. It reports that more than 60 per cent of insurers are currently working to mi- grate to cloud-based solutions.
In March 2021, the European Commission introduced the Transparency Directive (Sustainable Finance Dis- closure Regulation; SFDR) for financial service provid- ers. The directive governs the disclosure obligations of pro duct providers and financial advisors in terms of sustainability in strategies, processes and products. The regulatory requirements also apply to insurance brokers, life insurers and providers of company pension schemes. The Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) that expand on the directive are expected to apply from mid- 2022 onwards. This will increase the amount of regula- tory paperwork for life insurers and providers of compa- ny pension schemes.
With regard to old-age pensions, the German govern- ment has also decided to introduce a digital pension overview. It aims to provide customers with a quick over- view of their statutory, company and private pension en- titlements. The German Pension Overview Act (RentÜG) came into effect on 18 February 2021. The law requires all providers of private and company old-age pensions to connect to the portal if they are obliged to send regu- lar summaries to their customers while they are paying into the pension. After a 21-month development phase, the platform is set to go live in autumn 2023.

///Retrieved document 2: Personnel risks
msg life’s success depends crucially on the skills, qual- ifications and motivation of its employees. Certain em- ployees in key positions are particularly important in this respect. If msg life is unable to get these employ- ees to commit themselves to the company or to recruit qualified and skilled employees and develop them fur- ther on a continuous basis, msg life’s success can suffer significant adverse effects due to the resultant loss of expertise. In addition, an excessive burden on the com- pany’s own employees could necessitate the deploy- ment of expensive external capacities if the risk of qual- ity losses in project development is to be averted. This applies particularly when the likely demographic trends are taken into consideration. In connection with this, msg life will be affected particularly by the probable de- cline in graduate numbers, the resultant competition to recruit them and the increasing costs this will lead to.
msg life counters this risk with an extensive set of mea- sures. A continuous exchange of views with the em- ployees on all factors affecting their work environment at standardised interviews with a facility for qualified feedback, internal training to prevent monopolies of knowledge and skills, on-the-job graduate training and the recruitment of suitable people through all of the usual market channels are just a few examples of these. In addition, the leadership guidelines for managers are designed to strengthen the employees’ identification with the company.

Economic risks
Technological risks
The general economic trend affects the behaviour of potential customers as far as their investment in IT in- frastructure and their expenditure on ongoing manage- ment consulting are concerned. An economic downturn could reduce the volume of the market on which msg life has trained its sights. Any capacity adjustment mea- sures which are regarded as necessary to counter such developments might take effect only after a time lag and would lead to restructuring costs. With the volume-re- lated remuneration models, a delay in portfolio growth caused by the general economic situation could result in a postponement of the planned diminution in fixed costs.

There are no significant interest rate risks in relation to its financial assets. The investment of cash and cash equivalents is done on a short-term basis and under- goes the normal market fluctuations. On the condition that all other parameters remained unchanged, the company assumes that interest rates were ten base points lower (higher) in the reporting period. In this case, the net result for 2021 would have been 8,000 euros lower (higher) (previous year: 8,000 euros lower (higher)) and the equity components would have been 8,000 euros lower (higher) (previous year: 8,000 euros lower (higher)).
In the reporting period as well as the previous year, there were no (interest-bearing) financial liabilities with variable interest rates.

Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in exchange rates.

Overall assessment of the opportunities and risks
msg life believes that, in light of the likelihood of their occurrence and their effects, the risks described above do not represent a threat to the company’s continued existence either individually or as a whole. Senior man- agement remains confident that the Group’s earning power constitutes a solid basis for the future develop- ment of its business and will generate the resources that will be necessary for the Group to pursue the op- portunities that present themselves. In view of its lead- ing position on the market, its functional and techno- logical innovative power, its committed employees and its processes for the early identification of risks, msg life is confident that, in 2022, it will again be able to deal successfully with the challenges that arise from the aforementioned risks.

These steps include restrictive authorisation and access controls, regular backups and penetration tests and adequate contractual arrangements with service providers for outsourced systems and telephone and other communication links. In order to provide protec- tion against penetration by viruses, the latest software available on the market is deployed as a matter of prin- ciple. Access restrictions prevent potentially infected software from being installed on the msg life comput- er network without authorisation. Defined security re- quirements limit access by unauthorised persons and ensure that data is protected. Financial loss is limited by appropriate insurance policies.
Risks from takeovers
Competition risks
With its solutions, msg life is a leading sector-based service provider for life insurers and pension funds in Europe and in particular for health and group insurers in the United States. This has led to a concentration and therefore an increase in market development risks. At the same time, this increases the company’s profitabil- ity. msg life will therefore attempt to persevere with its existing strategy, including in its current product seg- ments and regional markets, and to cover entire value chains and product ranges with its solutions. In this way, it hopes to achieve a decisive competitive advantage on the market, particularly vis-à-vis new competitors with aggressive pricing policies.
msg life is currently interested in expanding its market position in German-speaking countries and internation- ally, primarily through organic growth. This can also be supported in parallel by strategic acquisitions. The suc- cess of an acquisition is dependent upon whether the acquired company can be successfully integrated in the Group structure and the desired synergy effects can be generated.
Liquidity risks
Managing liquidity risk includes ensuring that the com- pany always has sufficient liquid funds or credit lines available to enable it to meet its payment obligations and hedge against risks resulting from fluctuations in payment flows. Among other things, the payment ob- ligations consist of interest and redemption payments.

Liquidity risk also includes the risk of not being able to obtain sufficient liquidity at the expected terms when required (refinancing risk).

1,"The objective of financial risk management is to recognize and address significant risks at an early stage. The method involves monitoring and analyzing risks, implementing appropriate countermeasures, and ensuring the availability of sufficient liquid funds or credit lines to meet payment obligations.","///Retrieved document 0: Under the management mechanisms now in place, the daily holdings of cash and cash equivalents and the monthly rolling financial plans are monitored by the company’s management. The purpose of liquidity man- agement is to finance predictable deficits at standard market terms under normal market conditions. This means that losses from both borrowing capital at exces- sive interest rates as well as investing surplus funds at interest rates below the market level should be avoided.
Credit risks (default risks):
Credit risk arises from deteriorating economic circum- stances of the company’s debtors or counterparties. Firstly, this results in a risk of partial or complete default on contractually agreed payments and, secondly, in a reduction in the value of financial instruments due to a poorer credit rating.
Credit risk management is responsible for the opera- tional measurement and management of credit risks. Its functions include, in particular, monitoring credit risk positions and exposure and analysis of credit ratings.
Because of the company’s current holdings of cash and cash equivalents, msg life ag considers the liquidity risk to be low at present. The msg life Group has sufficient liquid funds to enable it to service its financial liabili- ties.
As at the balance sheet date, the company had loan agreements with three banks totalling 7.500 million eu- ros. As at the reporting date, the loans had been used in the amount of 1.560 million euros for security deposits.
Risk reporting in respect of the use of financial instruments
Objective and methods of financial risk management:
Financial risk management is designed to put the msg life Group in a position to recognise all the significant risks to which it is potentially exposed at an early stage and to take appropriate countermeasures.

Liquidity risks:
Managing liquidity risk includes ensuring that the com- pany always has sufficient liquid funds or credit lines available to enable it to meet its payment obligations and hedge against risks resulting from fluctuations in payment flows. Among other things, the payment ob- ligations consist of interest and redemption payments. Liquidity risk also includes the risk of not being able to obtain sufficient liquidity at the expected terms when required (refinancing risk).
Under the management mechanisms now in place, the daily holdings of cash and cash equivalents and the monthly rolling financial plans are monitored by the company’s management. The purpose of liquidity man- agement is to finance predictable deficits at standard market terms under normal market conditions. This

means that losses from both borrowing capital at exces- sive interest rates as well as investing surplus funds at interest rates below the market level should be avoided.
Because of the company’s large holdings of cash and cash equivalents, the msg life Group considers the li- quidity risk to be low at present. The msg life Group has sufficient liquid funds to enable it to service its financial liabilities.
In addition, as at the reporting date, there are cred- it lines with banks amounting to 7.5 million euros, of which 1.560 million euros had been used at the report- ing date for security deposits.
In the 2021 financial year and in the previous year, no income from debt waivers was realised.

Opportunity and risk report
General
All the following estimations regarding opportunities and risks were made on the reporting date, 31 Decem- ber 2021.
In the type of business it conducts, the msg life Group is exposed to a large number of uncertainties which, if realised, can affect the Group’s earnings, financial and assets position, and that of the company, either posi- tively or negatively, or result in msg life falling short of or exceeding the targets it has set itself for the future development of its business.
pliance management were incorporated into the early risk detection system. The corresponding risk report for 2021 was presented to the Supervisory Board in Febru- ary 2022.
In 2021, the msg life Group’s profile did not change sig- nificantly with regard to the main types of opportunity and risk areas to which it is exposed. Below, individual types of risk that are identified as being important are explained in greater detail. The specification of these risks does not imply that other risks which have not been mentioned will not have a significant impact on msg life’s earnings, financial and assets position.
Among the Management Board’s most important tasks in the overall management of the Group are, in close coordination with the Supervisory Board, laying down general conditions and processes of risk management for the msg life Group, monitoring the degree of com- pliance with them and, in conjunction with the heads of the operating units and the administrative departments, regularly analysing the development of risks in the re- spective segments.
The msg life Group’s risk management system is docu- mented in a risk manual. One employee in the holding company’s Organisation & IT Services division has been appointed risk manager of the Group and is thereby en- trusted with submitting the prevailing risk management system to regular internal evaluation and documenting this process. It is the responsibility of the managers of the individual divisions to continuously monitor and deal with the risks to which their own divisions are ex- posed.
The foundation of good risk management is the reliable and prompt provision of the management with relevant information about the course of business. For this pur- pose, msg life has set up a monthly controlling and re- porting system.

These risks include exceeding project budgets, missing deadlines, and failing to meet functional specifications or quality requirements. Additionally, the company faces the risk of employees falling ill or being unable to work on customer projects, as well as the potential impact of economic downturns on market demand for IT infrastructure and consulting services.","///Retrieved document 0: Project and product risks
The main potential source of risk in the course of op- erating activity lies in the calculation of the complex projects and in their organisational, functional, techni- cal and commercial handling. These risks are controlled and monitored by means of the valid Group-wide stan- dards for project and project risk management. The risk nevertheless remains that projects cannot be realised profitably for the msg life Group because costs exceed the agreed budget, deadlines cannot be met or the ser- vices rendered fail to comply with the agreed functional specifications or the required quality, and the msg life Group will therefore have to grant a discount or pay com- pensation. The overall risk profile of all ongoing projects was further reduced in 2021. The existing risks of indi- vidual projects have been appropriately taken into ac- count for 2022. The cumulative occurrence in multiple projects could, however, lead to negative effects.
In the 2021 financial year, particular attention was paid to the potential impact of the current Covid-19 pan- demic on the company. The company was quick to take comprehensive action in order to remain operational including, in particular, providing all employees with the necessary hardware and software to work remotely from home and moving almost all work to cyberspace both quickly and consistently. Nevertheless, there is a risk that msg life employees fall ill and are unable to work on customer projects or that customers are unable to perform the necessary supporting services. In turn, it might not be possible to reach agreed project mile- stones on time or at all, resulting in a negative impact on the economic development of the company. Looking at the 2021 financial year, it is once again evident that
The msg life Group also uses software from external suppliers in its own software products. This third-par- ty software can contain defects that might have an adverse effect on the functional capability of the msg life Group’s own products. Problems in the execution of projects and software defects that can occur in the operation of software produced by msg life can do last- ing damage to the reputation of the msg life Group and thereby have a substantial impact on the future course of business.

and development’ chapter within this condensed man- agement report and Group management report, the rel- evant R & D activities at msg life serve, firstly, the further development and enhancement of standard software solutions, and secondly, the expansion of available ex- pertise on consulting topics.
none of these risks arose and, for this reason – and also because of the steps taken by msg life and the perfor- mance of its project business in the current financial year 2022 – the company still sees no significant effects on its operating and financial performance as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic at the time these financial state- ments were prepared.
Product- and service-specific opportunities
In addition, msg life’s employees are crucial to the company’s innovative power and the customers’ value added – and are therefore instrumental in the growth and profitability of the msg life Group as a whole. More information about the future opportunities being gener- ated by msg life’s employees can be found in the ‘Em- ployees’ chapter within this condensed management report and Group management report.
Like all software products, the msg life Group’s pro- ducts can have defects whose elimination under guar- antee increases costs and thereby influences the profit margin or even leads to compensation claims against the msg life Group. The msg life companies generally assume the warranty which is customary in the indus- try. As far as possible, liability obligations are limited contractually to the legal minimum and are secured with appropriate liability insurance policies. It can neverthe- less not be entirely ruled out that contractually agreed limitations on liability will be regarded as invalid and the existing insurance cover will be available to an in- sufficient extent or not at all – even if this is improbable.
Risk assessment
The following risks are listed in descending order based on their estimated probability of occurrence and im- pacts. Additionally, unless indicated otherwise, the following disclosures concern all the fields of business.

msg life’s success depends crucially on the skills, qual- ifications and motivation of its employees. Certain em- ployees in key positions are particularly important in this respect. If msg life is unable to get these employ- ees to commit themselves to the company or to recruit qualified and skilled employees and develop them fur- ther on a continuous basis, msg life’s success can suffer significant adverse effects due to the resultant loss of expertise. In addition, an excessive burden on the com- pany’s own employees could necessitate the deploy- ment of expensive external capacities if the risk of qual- ity losses in project development is to be averted. This applies particularly when the likely demographic trends are taken into consideration. In connection with this, msg life will be affected particularly by the probable de- cline in graduate numbers, the resultant competition to recruit them and the increasing costs this will lead to.
msg life counters this risk with an extensive set of mea- sures. A continuous exchange of views with the em- ployees on all factors affecting their work environment at standardised interviews with a facility for qualified feedback, internal training to prevent monopolies of knowledge and skills, on-the-job graduate training and the recruitment of suitable people through all of the usual market channels are just a few examples of these. In addition, the leadership guidelines for managers are designed to strengthen the employees’ identification with the company.

The range of services offered by msg life in the United States encompasses not only software products and technical consulting services on all aspects of product and tariff structuring, but also operator models – with the latter generating growing interest in the market. In 2021, the company’s gained its first customers for such an operator model (i.e. SaaS) in which the customer pays a fee to use and operate the software.

Summarised evaluation of the company’s business situation
The 2021 financial year was another strong year for the msg life Group. Numerous sales successes with the cor- responding licence income, the very stable business with existing customers and continually low travel costs due to the still-ongoing coronavirus pandemic resulted in the targets set at the beginning of the financial year with regard to the financial key performance indicators of Group revenue from its own business (HGB) and Group earnings (HGB) being exceeded.
In the reporting period, the msg life Group recorded gross Group revenue from its own business under Ger- man GAAP of 176.1 million euros and Group earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) under German GAAP of 17.9 million euros.
The business situation of the company in the 2021 re- porting year can be described as positive overall. The foundations exist for positive development in 2022 and beyond. Last year’s prognosis in the separate financial statements forecast positive net results for the year; as the holding company, the individual Group company finished the 2021 financial year with net profit of 10.8 million euros.

///Retrieved document 1: For the most part, the operating companies of the Group carry out their business activities in their respective countries. The Group – with the exception of the United States – is therefore not exposed to any significant cur- rency risks in its operating business. A total of 90 per cent of its revenues are generated in eurozone countries (previous year: 87 per cent), and the remainder in Swit- zerland and the United States. The currency risk on the asset side in relation to trade receivables comes from receivables not denominated in euros, accounting for 15 per cent (previous year: 13 per cent). In the case of trade payables, currency risks occur in relation to the 3 per cent of liabilities not denominated in euros (previ- ous year: 5 per cent). Differences arising from currency conversion of financial statements from a foreign cur- rency to the Group currency for the creation of consol- idated financial statements do not affect currency risk because the respective changes in foreign currency are recognised under equity with no effect on income.
Market risks:
Market risks result from changes in market prices. These cause the fair values of financial instruments or future cash flows relating to them to fluctuate. Market risks encompass interest rate, currency and other price risks (such as commodity prices and share prices).
Price risks:
The msg life Group is not exposed to any price risks.
Information on risk concentration (concentration risks):
The company does not have any dependencies on the procurement side. On the sales side, there tend to be concentrations of risk due to the geographic distribu- tion of turnover. For example, Germany accounts for an 88.8 per cent share of turnover (previous year: 85.0 per cent).
Interest rate risks:
Interest rate risks result from a fluctuation in the fair val- ue or future cash flows of a financial instrument due to changes in market interest rates.
Within trade receivables, there is no significant con- centration on individual customers. In the year under review, the ten largest customers accounted for a 64.0 per cent share of turnover (previous year: 61.1 per cent) and a 33.7 per cent share of trade receivables (previous year: 37.9 per cent).

Adequate valuation al- lowances have been made to cover the estimated de- fault risk. As the credit rating of clients in the insurance industry is generally good, the receivables are not in- sured. The maximum default risk is in principle equiva- lent to the nominal values less the valuation allowances. There is no other loan collateral and there are no other risk-mitigating agreements (such as guarantees, land charges or pledges) in place. Usage reservations exist until payment is complete. For invoiced receivables, the net balance of additions to and reversals of valuation allowances was 819,000 euros (previous year: 14,000 euros). On each effective date, trade receivables do not include any carrying amounts for which terms have been renegotiated and which would otherwise be over- due.

The potential risks to the msg life Group associated with financial instruments consist notably of liquidity risks – which can result in a company being unable to raise the funds needed to settle its financial liabilities – currency risks resulting from its activities in various currency ar- eas, default risks arising from the non-fulfilment of con- tractual obligations by contracting parties and interest rate risks caused by movements in the market interest rate leading to a change in the fair value of a financial instrument and interest-related cash flow risks, which lead to a change in the future cash flows of a financial instrument due to changes in market interest rates.
Organisation:
The company has organised its risk management pro- cess along clear, functional lines. Specific tasks have been assigned to the individual organisational units involved in the risk management process. More infor- mation is available under ‘General’ in this section.

Senior man- agement remains confident that the Group’s earning power constitutes a solid basis for the future develop- ment of its business and will generate the resources that will be necessary for the Group to pursue the op- portunities that present themselves.

The goal is to increase the competitiveness of international insurance companies by offering a fully digitized end-to-end solution.,"///Retrieved document 0: With more than 1,200 employees at sites in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Slovakia, Slove- nia, Portugal, Spain and the United States, msg life is very well positioned in the field of software and consult- ing services for insurance companies and pension fund institutions. msg life’s wide range of digitised products and services for life insurance companies in Europe and, in particular, health and group insurance companies in the United States, gives it excellent market opportuni- ties and a promising competitive position.
In connection with its ongoing internationalisation strategy, msg life and IBM have entered into a partner- ship to open up new insurance markets. The goal is to significantly increase the competitiveness of interna- tional insurance companies through a fully digitised end-to-end solution, thereby securing their future.
In the past, the strategic presence of msg life in each foreign market was an important success factor when it came to attracting new customers. It is also becoming more and more apparent that Group companies want to put the solutions implemented for one region at the disposal of other Group companies in other countries – which can advance the ongoing internationalisation of msg life as a service provider for its customers. Besides the established partnership with IBM, the objective in the 2022 financial year is to press ahead with ma- jor sales projects, especially in the established foreign markets, as in the 2021 financial year.
The Benelux countries are an important market in this regard, where msg life, in cooperation with IBM, gained its largest new customer so far in AEGON in the Nether- lands, and is now working on the related introductory project.
The Austrian market is also a cornerstone of msg life’s international activities: msg life has enjoyed a number of highly significant successes there in recent years. The placement and further development of the consulting portfolio for the German-language markets and the mar- keting of msg life products in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is carried out from Vienna. On the Swiss market, too, msg life sees good prospects for the further expansion of its business and is represent- ed with its own offices and by various well-known life insurers such as AXA and Schweizerische Mobiliar. An innovative, AI-based and previously unique migration solution developed by msg life will be used at AXA in 2023 in the context of the acquisition of the legacy port- folio.

Overall, msg life continues to enjoy steady growth in the various insurance sectors in the US market and intends to exploit the potential for business that this represents. In addition to the implementation and integration of specific software products, the range of services offered by msg life encompasses a variety of consulting services in connection with product and tar- iff modelling, for example, as well as operator models – these are generating growing interest in the market.
The target group of the msg life Group company there is predominantly health and group insurers and, in fu- ture, will also include life insurers on the basis of the US product portfolio. The expansion and diversification of the company’s own range of solutions and partner- ships with specialised service providers are being used to unlock new customer groups. Now that the Biden ad- ministration has built on the Patient Protection and Af- fordable Care Act, msg life expects the state healthcare programmes such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid to grow further with the sales opportu- nities this provides. In the US market, msg life is also examining the potential for a commercial partnership in the field of health insurance.
Following an excellent 2021 financial year, msg life is registering a high level of demand for solutions in the first quarter of the current 2022 financial year – from insurance companies in Germany and other countries in equal measure. In this context, msg life also expects to see further regulation throughout the financial ser- vices sector. Be it the revision of Solvency II, the new international accounting standard IFRS 17, the Europe- an Transparency Directive, the rollout of a digital pen- sion overview or the introduction of PEPP, the ongoing implementation of numerous regulatory requirements necessitates comprehensive changes to the solutions which are currently used and ties up vast amounts of insurers’ resources. This means that the use of versatile, cost-effective standard software remains highly attrac- tive throughout the insurance industry.

///Retrieved document 2: The business of msg life in the United States for primar- ily health and group insurers was satisfactory up to the end of the reporting period. FJA-US, Inc. – the msg life Group company located in the United States – record- ed continuous successful development with solutions such as the Unified Distribution Platform, the Unified Product Platform and the web-based multi-channel platform msg.Sales. In the 2021 financial year, the com- pany attracted two new, well-known customers from the health and life insurance segments and recorded over- all growth in customer demand for services.
msg life serves the Spanish and Portuguese markets with an office in Spain and its own local office in Portu- gal which is now also being used as a product develop- ment unit. The development of msg life’s business with existing customers in that market was positive again in 2021 and it successfully managed to launch the project for its new customer, the non-life insurance company SegurCaixa Adeslas. Moreover, an acquisition was com- pleted successfully for Mutual Medica in Spain and the project began shortly after the end of the reporting peri- od. msg life continues to expect sales successes in that market in the current year.
msg life is serving the Central and Eastern European markets as well as other niche markets and segments from Slovenia in particular; as German-language in- surers are particularly striving to access these highly competitive markets, they regularly offer interesting sales opportunities for msg life. The company has a presence in many Eastern European countries with the Unified Administration Platform (UAP). As a result of the growing consulting business that is developing in connection with its local presences, msg life expects these markets to generate cross-selling effects. In the reporting period, SwissCaution awarded a contract to roll out the UAP. msg life received another contract for this system from Calingo Insurance AG in Switzerland, as well as from Zurich Cantonal Bank shortly after the end of the reporting period.
As previously reported, there were numerous new or- ders for msg life in 2021 and the company expects rele- vant new business in the 2022 financial year. Business with existing customers in connection with the software components was also strong. Additionally, nearly all of the major projects set out in the corporate plan were executed in the reporting period. As in previous years, msg life focused on sales projects in well-established markets in particular in the 2021 financial year.

Despite persistently difficult general conditions, private life insurance cover remains indispensable in Germany in view of the demographic trend and the necessity of covering against biometric risks. In the process, almost all insurers are striving to enhance their existing pro- duct ranges and develop new, innovative ones – this goes for all existing product groups, control layers and legal forms. The companies’ starting situations and the pressure on them to innovate vary and are consequent- ly bringing about a variety of innovations. The focus is on products that tick more than one box at the same time: products that satisfy the desire of the policyhold- ers for security, returns and flexibility, meet the needs of the insurer in terms of more efficiency and profitabil- ity and comply with the regulatory requirements at the same time.
In terms of the conventional capital accumulation pro- ducts, modifications of the guarantees are dominant, for example through the use of current calculation guidelines or by dispensing with the annual interest guarantee. With the biometric products, too, there is a great deal of action on the market. Dynamic hybrid products have become the standard now and there is a continuous flow of innovative products in addition to them which allow, for example, investment in funds, but also the purchasing of options on the basis of tra- ditional basic cover. Insurance companies at the larger end of the scale in particular are offering products for old-age provision with capital guarantees on the basis of unit-linked approaches with investment guarantees.

///Retrieved document 1: Given the current challenges, microservice-oriented ar- chitectures designed to quickly support modified busi- ness models and high system versatility for the rapid in- troduction of innovative products are factors crucial to the success of insurance companies. The developments in insurance products described above are typically not associated with particular product families. The plat- form economy is also playing a key role in the insurance industry this year: numerous insurers are now using platforms and ecosystems to provide digital products and services beyond what had previously been their core business – this in turn is opening up new ways to create value.
For larger insurance companies, the acquisition of closed insurance contract portfolios that are no lon- ger available for sale (‘run-off’ portfolios) from mainly smaller insurance companies remains an important fac- tor. This enables the latter to generate positive effects for their books, and buyers can generate significant economies of scale and cost synergies. Modern asset management with modern and powerful IT systems plays a decisive role in this regard as well in the more efficient management of contracts.
The digitisation of our economy and society has been accelerated greatly by the Covid-19 pandemic and re- mains one of the most significant challenges facing the German insurance industry. Digitised business pro- cesses enable the ever-greater integration of systems across divisions, segments and company boundaries. That makes it possible to exploit the potential repre- sented by the standardisation and automation of pro- cesses to a greater extent. Fully automated processes lead to enormous gains with regard to efficiency as well as significantly lower costs. The subjects of customer centricity and individualisation, industrialisation and automation, analytics and data effectiveness, and stan- dardisation and integration are at the heart of the digi- tisation trend. Insurers are increasingly committed to cloud solutions with which IT capacities can be adapted to meet the level of demand in a flexible manner.
With digitisation, modern insurance products and ser- vices can be made available on new channels or inte- grated into new sales and cooperation platforms; all of this requires extensive changes to the IT landscapes of insurers in order for the new technology and platforms to be integrated and is taken into account by msg life when it develops its products and services. The compa- ny already has SaaS and cloud-based solutions to sup- port its customers with the digitisation process, thanks in no small part to its strategic collaboration with IBM.

///Retrieved document 2: Likewise, insurers in the USA have survived the crisis rel- atively well. This is the conclusion of the article entitled ‘Der Versicherungsmarkt USA im Blick’ (‘A look at the US insurance market’) published by the R&D service pro- vider Versicherungsforen Leipzig in December 2021. It states that gross premiums grew by 0.6 per cent overall in 2020. Although growth of 1.2 per cent was achieved in the non-life segment, life premiums decreased by 1.4 per cent. With gross premiums of 2.5 billion dollars, the US insurance industry is a global market leader: the USA accounts for more than 40 per cent of the global market.
Development of business
In the German-speaking market, the msg life Group is the market leader with the services and products it of- fers for life insurers and pension fund institutions and more than half of all leading life insurers in these coun- tries are its customers. The Group’s research and devel- opment activities are aimed at continuously reinforcing its leading position. With the regulatory requirements still changing constantly and the increasingly dynamic variety of products, insurance companies are increas- ingly pursuing a strategy of replacing their previous in- house software solutions with standard software.
msg life’s products and consulting services are now a fixed part of the msg Group’s portfolio for the insurance industry. And as an associated company in the msg Group, msg life is an even more significant strategic partner for its customers and an even more attractive employer for the employees.
Insurers’ expenses on IT also reflect the relevance of digitisation: according to the GDV, the insurance in- dustry invested around 5.6 billion euros in its IT in the 2020 financial year, compared to around 5.5 billion eu- ros in 2019. At 2.55 per cent, the IT cost ratio (the ratio of IT expenses to companies’ gross premium income) remained almost constant. According to the GDV publi-
In the TRAIL.X (TRustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Life Insurance) project that was launched in 2021, msg life and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich are de- veloping deep neural networks (DNNs) for the actuarial computation module.

In the 2021 financial year, proper- ty, plant and equipment decreased by 1.1 million euros. Overall, intangible assets decreased by 0.4 million eu- ros to 1.0 million euros. Before they were netted against deferred tax liabilities, the deferred tax assets totalled 0.3 million euros (previous year: 0.4 million euros).
Expenses for the procurement of services were 11.6 mil- lion euros lower than in the previous year and amount- ed to 28.4 million euros in the financial year ended (pre- vious year: 40.0 million euros).
Both in the 2021 financial year and in the same period in the previous year, the development of msg life ag’s turnover and expenses resulting from the procurement of services was mainly due to the interim delivery of a milestone within the framework of a major project with msg systems ag.
At 8.4 million euros (previous year: 8.9 million euros), personnel expenses were just 0.5 million euros lower than the previous year.
Provisions decreased by a total of 1.8 million euros to 25.8 million euros. Essentially, this change was due to the decrease in other provisions by 2.7 million euros to 17.7 million euros.
The item of depreciation of property, plant and equip- ment from the separate financial statements prepared in accordance with German GAAP (HGB) decreased slightly to 0.4 million euros in the financial year ended (previous year: 0.5 million euros).
All in all, provisions account for 25.9 per cent of the balance sheet total, compared with 33.6 per cent in the previous year.
Liabilities amounted to 13.2 million euros. The increase of 4.4 million euros compared to the previous year is due to the increase in liabilities to affiliated companies of 3.6 million euros to 7.5 million euros, an increase in trade payables of 1.5 million euros and the decrease in other liabilities by 0.7 million euros to 2.6 million euros.

As in the previous year, the main component of other operating expenses is rent for office space of 7.0 million euros (primarily renting).
Over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, travel ex- penses associated with products decreased further and were just 0.4 million euros in the 2021 financial year (previous year: 0.9 million euros).

Summarised evaluation of the company’s business situation
The 2021 financial year was another strong year for the msg life Group. Numerous sales successes with the cor- responding licence income, the very stable business with existing customers and continually low travel costs due to the still-ongoing coronavirus pandemic resulted in the targets set at the beginning of the financial year with regard to the financial key performance indicators of Group revenue from its own business (HGB) and Group earnings (HGB) being exceeded.
In the reporting period, the msg life Group recorded gross Group revenue from its own business under Ger- man GAAP of 176.1 million euros and Group earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) under German GAAP of 17.9 million euros.
The business situation of the company in the 2021 re- porting year can be described as positive overall. The foundations exist for positive development in 2022 and beyond. Last year’s prognosis in the separate financial statements forecast positive net results for the year; as the holding company, the individual Group company finished the 2021 financial year with net profit of 10.8 million euros.

For this reason – and also because of the steps taken by msg life and the performance of its project business in the current financial year 2022 – the company still sees no significant effects on its operating and financial performance as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic at the time these financial state-

With regard to the US market, msg life is currently exam- ining whether it would be possible to deploy a localised version of its portfolio of European life insurance prod- ucts in connection with its specific US products as an integrated solution. Overall, msg life continues to enjoy steady growth in the various insurance sectors in the US market and intends to exploit the potential for business that this represents. In addition to the implementation and integration of specific software products, the range of services offered by msg life encompasses a variety of consulting services in connection with product and tar- iff modelling, for example, as well as operator models – these are generating growing interest in the market.
The target group of the msg life Group company there is predominantly health and group insurers and, in fu- ture, will also include life insurers on the basis of the US product portfolio. The expansion and diversification of the company’s own range of solutions and partner- ships with specialised service providers are being used to unlock new customer groups. Now that the Biden ad- ministration has built on the Patient Protection and Af- fordable Care Act, msg life expects the state healthcare programmes such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid to grow further with the sales opportu- nities this provides. In the US market, msg life is also examining the potential for a commercial partnership in the field of health insurance.
Following an excellent 2021 financial year, msg life is registering a high level of demand for solutions in the first quarter of the current 2022 financial year – from insurance companies in Germany and other countries in equal measure. In this context, msg life also expects to see further regulation throughout the financial ser- vices sector. Be it the revision of Solvency II, the new international accounting standard IFRS 17, the Europe- an Transparency Directive, the rollout of a digital pen- sion overview or the introduction of PEPP, the ongoing implementation of numerous regulatory requirements necessitates comprehensive changes to the solutions which are currently used and ties up vast amounts of insurers’ resources. This means that the use of versatile, cost-effective standard software remains highly attrac- tive throughout the insurance industry.

///Retrieved document 1: The business of msg life in the United States for primar- ily health and group insurers was satisfactory up to the end of the reporting period. FJA-US, Inc. – the msg life Group company located in the United States – record- ed continuous successful development with solutions such as the Unified Distribution Platform, the Unified Product Platform and the web-based multi-channel platform msg.Sales. In the 2021 financial year, the com- pany attracted two new, well-known customers from the health and life insurance segments and recorded over- all growth in customer demand for services.
msg life serves the Spanish and Portuguese markets with an office in Spain and its own local office in Portu- gal which is now also being used as a product develop- ment unit. The development of msg life’s business with existing customers in that market was positive again in 2021 and it successfully managed to launch the project for its new customer, the non-life insurance company SegurCaixa Adeslas. Moreover, an acquisition was com- pleted successfully for Mutual Medica in Spain and the project began shortly after the end of the reporting peri- od. msg life continues to expect sales successes in that market in the current year.
msg life is serving the Central and Eastern European markets as well as other niche markets and segments from Slovenia in particular; as German-language in- surers are particularly striving to access these highly competitive markets, they regularly offer interesting sales opportunities for msg life. The company has a presence in many Eastern European countries with the Unified Administration Platform (UAP). As a result of the growing consulting business that is developing in connection with its local presences, msg life expects these markets to generate cross-selling effects. In the reporting period, SwissCaution awarded a contract to roll out the UAP. msg life received another contract for this system from Calingo Insurance AG in Switzerland, as well as from Zurich Cantonal Bank shortly after the end of the reporting period.
As previously reported, there were numerous new or- ders for msg life in 2021 and the company expects rele- vant new business in the 2022 financial year. Business with existing customers in connection with the software components was also strong. Additionally, nearly all of the major projects set out in the corporate plan were executed in the reporting period. As in previous years, msg life focused on sales projects in well-established markets in particular in the 2021 financial year.

In connection with its ongoing internationalisation strategy, msg life and IBM have entered into a partner- ship to open up new insurance markets. The goal is to significantly increase the competitiveness of interna- tional insurance companies through a fully digitised end-to-end solution, thereby securing their future.
In the past, the strategic presence of msg life in each foreign market was an important success factor when it came to attracting new customers. It is also becoming more and more apparent that Group companies want to put the solutions implemented for one region at the disposal of other Group companies in other countries – which can advance the ongoing internationalisation of msg life as a service provider for its customers. Besides the established partnership with IBM, the objective in the 2022 financial year is to press ahead with ma- jor sales projects, especially in the established foreign markets, as in the 2021 financial year.
The Benelux countries are an important market in this regard, where msg life, in cooperation with IBM, gained its largest new customer so far in AEGON in the Nether- lands, and is now working on the related introductory project.
The Austrian market is also a cornerstone of msg life’s international activities: msg life has enjoyed a number of highly significant successes there in recent years. The placement and further development of the consulting portfolio for the German-language markets and the mar- keting of msg life products in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is carried out from Vienna. On the Swiss market, too, msg life sees good prospects for the further expansion of its business and is represent- ed with its own offices and by various well-known life insurers such as AXA and Schweizerische Mobiliar.

The US insurance industry is a global market leader, accounting for more than 40 percent of the global market.","///Retrieved document 0: Under the more difficult conditions of the Covid-19 pan- demic, the German insurance industry closed the 2021 financial year with a ‘solid’ performance, concludes Wolfgang Weiler, president of the Gesamtverband der Deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft (GDV), at its annual media conference in January 2022. He announced that insurers reported an increase in premiums of 1.1 per cent (previous year: 1.6 per cent) across all segments, reaching 223.4 billion euros.
The outlook for 2022 is cautiously optimistic. Accord- ing to the GDV, the industry expects premium growth of between 2 and 3 per cent. With regard to life insur- ance, the Covid-19 pandemic can be expected to have an impact on business prospects in the current year too. Premium growth of between 1 and 2 per cent could be considered realistic here. The GDV expects a weaker performance from traditional life insurance products, although market-oriented products are expected to grow more strongly. ‘The decisive factors here are the economic prospects of private households and the gen- eral political conditions for private old-age pensions in the current legislative period’, said Weiler.
The GDV goes on to report that the premium income of life insurers and pension funds amounted to around 102 billion euros in the financial year ended. That amount is 1.4 per cent lower than in 2020. Whereas current pre- mium income increased slightly to 65.3 billion euros, one-time premiums declined to 36.5 billion euros (-4.7 per cent).
According to the GDV, new Riester business performed well with growth of 12 per cent to 310,500 contracts. The portfolio largely remained stable, with around 10.4 mil- lion contracts. With regard to basic pensions, the num- ber of newly brokered policies increased by almost 40 per cent to 119,000 contracts. This caused the overall portfolio to grow by 4 per cent to 2.5 million contracts.

Development of business
In the German-speaking market, the msg life Group is the market leader with the services and products it of- fers for life insurers and pension fund institutions and more than half of all leading life insurers in these coun- tries are its customers. The Group’s research and devel- opment activities are aimed at continuously reinforcing its leading position.

Economic report
Macroeconomic and sector-specific conditions
At the time of writing of the condensed management report and Group management report, the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 on the general economic and sector-specific conditions in the current 2022 financial year and beyond was not yet evident and has therefore not been taken into account in the follow- ing disclosures regarding both subject areas.
With regard to Europe, the experts at the IMF expect the economy to grow by 5.0 per cent in 2021 and by 4.3 per cent this year. The forecasts of the OECD (Organisa- tion for Economic Co-operation and Development) are somewhat more optimistic: The experts expect growth of 5.2 per cent in the previous year and 4.3 per cent in 2022. According to the experts, new variants of Covid-19 and insufficient rates of vaccination are just two factors that represent risks. Additionally, economic stimulus packages are running out and corrections are looming on the property markets.
The Covid-19 pandemic continues to overshadow in- ternational economic activity. According to the Global Economic Prospect Report published by the World Bank in January 2022, the global economy is in a distinct de- cline compounded by new variants of Covid-19 as well as high inflation, debt and income inequality, following a strong upturn in 2021. Economists expect the global growth rate to fall from 5.5 per cent in 2021 to 4.1 per cent this year. The World Bank expects it to increase by 3.2 per cent in 2023.

1,"Some key developments in the insurance industry include the adoption of microservice-oriented architectures for rapid innovation and flexibility, the use of platforms and ecosystems to expand digital products and services, the acquisition of closed insurance contract portfolios for economies of scale, and the digitization of business processes for efficiency and cost reduction. Additionally, there is a focus on developing innovative insurance products that meet policyholders' needs for security, returns, and flexibility while complying with regulatory requirements.","///Retrieved document 0: Given the current challenges, microservice-oriented ar- chitectures designed to quickly support modified busi- ness models and high system versatility for the rapid in- troduction of innovative products are factors crucial to the success of insurance companies. The developments in insurance products described above are typically not associated with particular product families. The plat- form economy is also playing a key role in the insurance industry this year: numerous insurers are now using platforms and ecosystems to provide digital products and services beyond what had previously been their core business – this in turn is opening up new ways to create value.
For larger insurance companies, the acquisition of closed insurance contract portfolios that are no lon- ger available for sale (‘run-off’ portfolios) from mainly smaller insurance companies remains an important fac- tor. This enables the latter to generate positive effects for their books, and buyers can generate significant economies of scale and cost synergies. Modern asset management with modern and powerful IT systems plays a decisive role in this regard as well in the more efficient management of contracts.
The digitisation of our economy and society has been accelerated greatly by the Covid-19 pandemic and re- mains one of the most significant challenges facing the German insurance industry. Digitised business pro- cesses enable the ever-greater integration of systems across divisions, segments and company boundaries. That makes it possible to exploit the potential repre- sented by the standardisation and automation of pro- cesses to a greater extent. Fully automated processes lead to enormous gains with regard to efficiency as well as significantly lower costs. The subjects of customer centricity and individualisation, industrialisation and automation, analytics and data effectiveness, and stan- dardisation and integration are at the heart of the digi- tisation trend. Insurers are increasingly committed to cloud solutions with which IT capacities can be adapted to meet the level of demand in a flexible manner.
With digitisation, modern insurance products and ser- vices can be made available on new channels or inte- grated into new sales and cooperation platforms; all of this requires extensive changes to the IT landscapes of insurers in order for the new technology and platforms to be integrated and is taken into account by msg life when it develops its products and services. The compa- ny already has SaaS and cloud-based solutions to sup- port its customers with the digitisation process, thanks in no small part to its strategic collaboration with IBM.

Despite persistently difficult general conditions, private life insurance cover remains indispensable in Germany in view of the demographic trend and the necessity of covering against biometric risks. In the process, almost all insurers are striving to enhance their existing pro- duct ranges and develop new, innovative ones – this goes for all existing product groups, control layers and legal forms. The companies’ starting situations and the pressure on them to innovate vary and are consequent- ly bringing about a variety of innovations. The focus is on products that tick more than one box at the same time: products that satisfy the desire of the policyhold- ers for security, returns and flexibility, meet the needs of the insurer in terms of more efficiency and profitabil- ity and comply with the regulatory requirements at the same time.
In terms of the conventional capital accumulation pro- ducts, modifications of the guarantees are dominant, for example through the use of current calculation guidelines or by dispensing with the annual interest guarantee. With the biometric products, too, there is a great deal of action on the market. Dynamic hybrid products have become the standard now and there is a continuous flow of innovative products in addition to them which allow, for example, investment in funds, but also the purchasing of options on the basis of tra- ditional basic cover. Insurance companies at the larger end of the scale in particular are offering products for old-age provision with capital guarantees on the basis of unit-linked approaches with investment guarantees.

1,"The Federal Ministry of Finance decided to lower the projected interest rate for new life insurance contracts due to the persistently low interest rates that have remained for years. The German actuarial association had called for this change as extensive premium guarantees were no longer reasonable from an actuarial standpoint. Additionally, there were no signs of a noticeable recovery in interest rates in the near future, especially considering the economic uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.","///Retrieved document 0: In light of interest rates having remained low for years, the Federal Ministry of Finance decided in March 2021 to lower the projected interest rate for new life insur- ance contracts from 0.9 per cent to 0.25 per cent from 1 January 2022 onwards. The German actuarial associ- ation Deutsche Aktuarvereinigung (DAV) had called for this to happen numerous times, as extensive premium guarantees were no longer reasonable from an actuari- al standpoint due to the persistently low interest rates. In November last year, the DAV also recommended that this level remain in place until 2023: ‘We do not current- ly see signs of a noticeable recovery in interest rates in the near future, not least in light of the economic uncer- tainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic’, said Herbert Schneidemann, chairman of the DAV, to support the recommendation.
For this reason, more and more insurers are developing new products with different guarantee models, moving away from traditional policies with guaranteed interest in the process. In the financial year ended, some insur- ers even abandoned the 100 per cent premium guar- antee completely. They only offer a complete premium guarantee where they are required by law to do so.
Regulatory matters were also high on the list of insurers’ priorities in the financial year ended. Be it the Europe- an Transparency Directive, the revision of Solvency II or the introduction of new international financial reporting rules (IFRS 17), the implementation of statutory regula- tions has made it necessary to make extensive adjust- ments. For many companies, this is a tremendous effort

///Retrieved document 1: The rating agency Moody’s is confident about German life insurers: ‘The pressure on life insurance is lifting gradually’, said Christian Badorff, a credit analyst at Moody’s, according to the business newspaper Han- delsblatt in October 2021. Although the industry is still under pressure in 2022 due to low interest rates, it is set to stabilise. Moody’s has upgraded its outlook for the sector from negative to stable. Life insurers are increas- ingly shifting new business to products that protect cap- ital, it continues. Additionally, the additional interest reserves have suppressed the risks of their long-term interest guarantees.
The persistently low interest rates were a concern of the insurance industry in the 2021 financial year as well. The ECB launched a multi-billion-euro emergen- cy purchase programme in March 2020 to mitigate the severe economic impacts of the Covid-19 crisis: under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), the ECB will purchase up to 1.85 billion euros’ worth of government and corporate bonds until March 2022 at the earliest.
In September 2021, the ECB decided to reduce the rate of PEPP purchases moderately. The ECB announced its decision at the most recent ECB meeting on 3 February 2022. At the same time, the ECB left the key interest rate in the Eurozone at 0 per cent, while the deposit facili- ty rate also remained unchanged at -0.5 per cent. This means that banks must continue to pay penalty rates if they deposit surplus money with the ECB.
In light of the rapid rise in inflation, ECB President Christine Lagarde refused to rule out an interest rate increase this year. As such, the ECB is prepared to ad- just all available instruments in order to reach its 2 per cent inflation target in the medium term. Lagarde made an announcement to this effect at the press conference afterwards. According to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, the rate of inflation in Eurozone countries rose from 5.0 per cent in December 2021 to 5.1 per cent in January 2022. High energy costs were the main driver. According to the Federal Statistical Office, inflation in Germany fell to 4.9 per cent in January 2022 from 5.3 per cent in the previous month.

///Retrieved document 2: Under the more difficult conditions of the Covid-19 pan- demic, the German insurance industry closed the 2021 financial year with a ‘solid’ performance, concludes Wolfgang Weiler, president of the Gesamtverband der Deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft (GDV), at its annual media conference in January 2022. He announced that insurers reported an increase in premiums of 1.1 per cent (previous year: 1.6 per cent) across all segments, reaching 223.4 billion euros.
The outlook for 2022 is cautiously optimistic. Accord- ing to the GDV, the industry expects premium growth of between 2 and 3 per cent. With regard to life insur- ance, the Covid-19 pandemic can be expected to have an impact on business prospects in the current year too. Premium growth of between 1 and 2 per cent could be considered realistic here. The GDV expects a weaker performance from traditional life insurance products, although market-oriented products are expected to grow more strongly. ‘The decisive factors here are the economic prospects of private households and the gen- eral political conditions for private old-age pensions in the current legislative period’, said Weiler.
The GDV goes on to report that the premium income of life insurers and pension funds amounted to around 102 billion euros in the financial year ended. That amount is 1.4 per cent lower than in 2020. Whereas current pre- mium income increased slightly to 65.3 billion euros, one-time premiums declined to 36.5 billion euros (-4.7 per cent).
According to the GDV, new Riester business performed well with growth of 12 per cent to 310,500 contracts. The portfolio largely remained stable, with around 10.4 mil- lion contracts. With regard to basic pensions, the num- ber of newly brokered policies increased by almost 40 per cent to 119,000 contracts. This caused the overall portfolio to grow by 4 per cent to 2.5 million contracts.

///Retrieved document 1: Finally, the launch of a voluntary Pan-European Pen- sion Product (PEPP) has been decided on a European level. The regulatory technical standards were defined in March 2021. PEPP is to be available throughout Eu- rope, although providers will have to meet strict criteria before they are permitted to offer it. The European pen- sion is designed to be complementary to existing state, statutory and occupational pension systems. Potential providers of the pension include insurance companies, company pension funds, banks and administrators of alternative investment funds.
Digitisation also remains at the top of the agenda for the German insurance industry. In particular, digitisa- tion has been accelerated greatly by the Covid-19 crisis. Digitised business processes enable the ever-greater integration of systems across divisions, segments and company boundaries. That makes it possible to exploit the potential represented by the standardisation and automation of processes to a greater extent. Fully auto- mated processes lead to enormous gains with regard to efficiency as well as significantly lower costs.
In Europe, the insurance industry largely managed to remain on track in 2020, the first year of the pandemic, according to the European Insurance Study 2021 pub- lished by Zeb Consulting in December 2021. Although insurers did have to accept larger drops in profits and premiums in some cases, the industry was in good over- all condition when it was hit by the crisis, enabling it to mostly remain profitable. Even the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) describes the European insurance industry as ‘fundamentally ro- bust’. This is demonstrated by the results of the stress test 2021 that were published in December 2021. The test included 43 major European insurance groups, in- cluding five from Germany.

///Retrieved document 1: Likewise, insurers in the USA have survived the crisis rel- atively well. This is the conclusion of the article entitled ‘Der Versicherungsmarkt USA im Blick’ (‘A look at the US insurance market’) published by the R&D service pro- vider Versicherungsforen Leipzig in December 2021. It states that gross premiums grew by 0.6 per cent overall in 2020. Although growth of 1.2 per cent was achieved in the non-life segment, life premiums decreased by 1.4 per cent. With gross premiums of 2.5 billion dollars, the US insurance industry is a global market leader: the USA accounts for more than 40 per cent of the global market.
Development of business
In the German-speaking market, the msg life Group is the market leader with the services and products it of- fers for life insurers and pension fund institutions and more than half of all leading life insurers in these coun- tries are its customers. The Group’s research and devel- opment activities are aimed at continuously reinforcing its leading position. With the regulatory requirements still changing constantly and the increasingly dynamic variety of products, insurance companies are increas- ingly pursuing a strategy of replacing their previous in- house software solutions with standard software.
msg life’s products and consulting services are now a fixed part of the msg Group’s portfolio for the insurance industry. And as an associated company in the msg Group, msg life is an even more significant strategic partner for its customers and an even more attractive employer for the employees.
Insurers’ expenses on IT also reflect the relevance of digitisation: according to the GDV, the insurance in- dustry invested around 5.6 billion euros in its IT in the 2020 financial year, compared to around 5.5 billion eu- ros in 2019. At 2.55 per cent, the IT cost ratio (the ratio of IT expenses to companies’ gross premium income) remained almost constant. According to the GDV publi-

At the time of writing of the condensed management report and Group management report, the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 on the general economic and sector-specific conditions in the current 2022 financial year and beyond was not yet evident and has therefore not been taken into account in the follow- ing disclosures regarding both subject areas.
With regard to Europe, the experts at the IMF expect the economy to grow by 5.0 per cent in 2021 and by 4.3 per cent this year. The forecasts of the OECD (Organisa- tion for Economic Co-operation and Development) are somewhat more optimistic: The experts expect growth of 5.2 per cent in the previous year and 4.3 per cent in 2022. According to the experts, new variants of Covid-19 and insufficient rates of vaccination are just two factors that represent risks. Additionally, economic stimulus packages are running out and corrections are looming on the property markets.
The Covid-19 pandemic continues to overshadow in- ternational economic activity. According to the Global Economic Prospect Report published by the World Bank in January 2022, the global economy is in a distinct de- cline compounded by new variants of Covid-19 as well as high inflation, debt and income inequality, following a strong upturn in 2021. Economists expect the global growth rate to fall from 5.5 per cent in 2021 to 4.1 per cent this year. The World Bank expects it to increase by 3.2 per cent in 2023.

The legal representatives are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated fi- nancial statements that comply, in all material respects, with German GAAP, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, financial and earnings position of the Group. In addition, the legal representatives are responsible for such internal controls as they have deemed necessary in line with German GAAP to enable the preparation of con- solidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the legal representatives are re- sponsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.
Furthermore, the legal representatives are responsible for the preparation of the con- densed management report and Group management report that, as a whole, provide an appropriate view of the Group’s position and are, in all material respects, consis- tent with the consolidated financial statements, comply with German legal require- ments, and appropriately present the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the legal representatives are responsible for such precautions and mea- sures (systems) as they deem necessary to enable the preparation of a condensed management report and Group management report that are consistent with the ap- plicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the condensed management report and Group man- agement report.
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

///Retrieved document 1: Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the condensed management report and Group manage- ment report as a whole provide an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, are consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, comply with the German legal requirements and appropriately present the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the condensed management report and Group management re- port.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and with consideration for the German Generally Accepted Standards on Auditing as promulgated by the IDW will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably

be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and the condensed management report and Group management report.
We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism through- out the audit. We also:
— Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated finan- cial statements, condensed management report and Group management report, whether due to fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstate- ment resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control;
— Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit of the consoli- dated financial statements and of precautions and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the condensed management report and Group management report in order to plan audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these sys- tems;

— Conclude on the appropriateness of the legal representatives’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signif- icant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the audi- tor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, condensed management report and Group management report or, if such disclo- sures are inadequate, to modify our opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern;
— Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated fi- nancial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated fi- nancial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, financial and earnings position of the Group in compliance with German GAAP;

— Perform audit procedures on the prospective disclosures presented by the le- gal representatives in the condensed management report and Group manage- ment report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the legal representatives as a basis for the prospective information and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information

1,"The IMF forecasts economic growth of 4.3% in Europe for 2022. The OECD is slightly more optimistic, predicting growth of 4.3% in the same year.","///Retrieved document 0: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently down- graded the forecast it released last October in its up- dated World Economic Outlook in January 2022. The IMF expects the global economy to grow by just 4.4 per cent this year, following growth of 5.9 per cent last year – 0.5 per cent less than initially forecast. The IMF attributes this to the current Covid-19 situation, supply bottle- necks and the high rate of inflation. Like the World Bank, the IMF predicts growth of 3.2 per cent in 2023.
The IMF has downgraded its forecast by 1.2 percentage points to 4 per cent for the USA this year, the world’s largest economy. The IMF has even downgraded its fore- cast by 0.8 percentage points to 4.8 per cent for China, the world’s second-largest economy.
According to the IMF, the dramatic rise in inflation will remain high in 2022 due to ongoing supply difficulties and high energy prices. The organisation expects in- dustrialised nations to see an average inflation rate of 3.9 per cent. The average rate of inflation in developing countries and emerging economies is expected to be 5.9 per cent.
According to the calculations of the Federal Statistical Office, Germany’s GDP grew by 2.8 per cent in 2021 after having fallen by 4.6 per cent in the same period in the previous year. ‘After economic performance had increased again last summer despite growing delivery bottlenecks and material shortages, the recovery of the German economy came to a halt at the end of the year due to the fourth Covid-19 wave and another reinforce- ment of Covid-19 preventive measures’, reported the Federal Statistical Office in January 2022. Compared to the crisis in 2020, economic performance improved in almost every area in 2021. However, it has not yet reached its pre-crisis level.

///Retrieved document 1: The economic performance of the manufacturing sector improved by 4.4 per cent year-on-year. The aggregated economic sector of trade, transport, accommodation and food services saw growth of just 3.0 per cent. Fol- lowing growth of 3.8 per cent in 2020, the construction sector reported a slight decline of 0.4 per cent. Other services, which include culture, entertainment, sports and creative activities, were hit particularly hard by the crisis: Their economic performance grew by just 0.6 per cent, following a decline of 10.5 per cent in the same period in the previous year.
In 2021, foreign trade recovered from the dramatic set- back it suffered in 2020. Germany exported 9.4 per cent more goods and services abroad than in the same pe- riod in the previous year. Imports grew by 8.6 per cent. This means that foreign trade in 2021 was only slightly below the level it had reached in 2019.
The German government expects the country’s econom- ic recovery to accelerate over the course of the year. That being said, it is set to be less strong than initial- ly predicted. ‘The impact of the coronavirus pandemic

The GDP is expected to grow by 3.6 per cent year-on-year. As such, economic performance will surpass its pre-crisis levels for the first time. As recent- ly as December 2021, major German economic institu- tions downgraded their forecasts for 2022. For example, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy lowered its GDP forecast from 5.1 per cent to 4.0 per cent and the Halle Institute for Economic Research downgraded its growth forecast from 4.8 per cent to 3.5 per cent.

Macroeconomic and sector-specific conditions
At the time of writing of the condensed management report and Group management report, the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 on the general economic and sector-specific conditions in the current 2022 financial year and beyond was not yet evident and has therefore not been taken into account in the follow- ing disclosures regarding both subject areas.
With regard to Europe, the experts at the IMF expect the economy to grow by 5.0 per cent in 2021 and by 4.3 per cent this year. The forecasts of the OECD (Organisa- tion for Economic Co-operation and Development) are somewhat more optimistic: The experts expect growth of 5.2 per cent in the previous year and 4.3 per cent in 2022. According to the experts, new variants of Covid-19 and insufficient rates of vaccination are just two factors that represent risks. Additionally, economic stimulus packages are running out and corrections are looming on the property markets.
The Covid-19 pandemic continues to overshadow in- ternational economic activity. According to the Global Economic Prospect Report published by the World Bank in January 2022, the global economy is in a distinct de- cline compounded by new variants of Covid-19 as well as high inflation, debt and income inequality, following a strong upturn in 2021. Economists expect the global growth rate to fall from 5.5 per cent in 2021 to 4.1 per cent this year. The World Bank expects it to increase by 3.2 per cent in 2023.

With regard to the US market, msg life is currently exam- ining whether it would be possible to deploy a localised version of its portfolio of European life insurance prod- ucts in connection with its specific US products as an integrated solution. Overall, msg life continues to enjoy steady growth in the various insurance sectors in the US market and intends to exploit the potential for business that this represents. In addition to the implementation and integration of specific software products, the range of services offered by msg life encompasses a variety of consulting services in connection with product and tar- iff modelling, for example, as well as operator models – these are generating growing interest in the market.
The target group of the msg life Group company there is predominantly health and group insurers and, in fu- ture, will also include life insurers on the basis of the US product portfolio. The expansion and diversification of the company’s own range of solutions and partner- ships with specialised service providers are being used to unlock new customer groups. Now that the Biden ad- ministration has built on the Patient Protection and Af- fordable Care Act, msg life expects the state healthcare programmes such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid to grow further with the sales opportu- nities this provides. In the US market, msg life is also examining the potential for a commercial partnership in the field of health insurance.
Following an excellent 2021 financial year, msg life is registering a high level of demand for solutions in the first quarter of the current 2022 financial year – from insurance companies in Germany and other countries in equal measure. In this context, msg life also expects to see further regulation throughout the financial ser- vices sector. Be it the revision of Solvency II, the new international accounting standard IFRS 17, the Europe- an Transparency Directive, the rollout of a digital pen- sion overview or the introduction of PEPP, the ongoing implementation of numerous regulatory requirements necessitates comprehensive changes to the solutions which are currently used and ties up vast amounts of insurers’ resources. This means that the use of versatile, cost-effective standard software remains highly attrac- tive throughout the insurance industry.

The company has a presence in many Eastern European countries with the Unified Administration Platform (UAP). As a result of the growing consulting business that is developing in connection with its local presences, msg life expects these markets to generate cross-selling effects. In the reporting period, SwissCaution awarded a contract to roll out the UAP. msg life received another contract for this system from Calingo Insurance AG in Switzerland, as well as from Zurich Cantonal Bank shortly after the end of the reporting period.
As previously reported, there were numerous new or- ders for msg life in 2021 and the company expects rele- vant new business in the 2022 financial year. Business with existing customers in connection with the software components was also strong. Additionally, nearly all of the major projects set out in the corporate plan were executed in the reporting period. As in previous years, msg life focused on sales projects in well-established markets in particular in the 2021 financial year.

///Retrieved document 2: The Supervisory Board conducted its own detailed au- dit of the annual financial statements, the consolidat- ed financial statements, the condensed management report and the Group management report, and raised no objections to them. In its meeting on 29 April 2022, the Supervisory Board adopted the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements prepared by the Management Board. Consequently, the annual financial statements were adopted in accor- dance with section 172 of the AktG.
At the meeting held after the annual general meeting on 24 June 2021, the Supervisory Board appointed, from among its members, Johann Zehetmaier as Chairman and Dr Martin Strobel as Deputy Chairman. Alongside the current business situation, the Management Board also reported to the Supervisory Board about the cur- rent status of the collaboration between msg life and msg nexinsure in particular.
On 23 September 2021, the Management Board and the Supervisory Board discussed the ongoing development of business and sales. They also discussed the strategy of the company in international markets and a publicly funded project in which msg life and the Ludwig Maxi- milian University of Munich are developing an innova- tive AI-based migration solution. Additionally, the Man- agement Board informed the Supervisory Board about msg insur:it, the planned new co-brand between msg life and msg nexinsure.
In its meeting on 15 December 2021, the Supervisory Board discussed issues including the current business situation and the strategic development of the msg life Group in great depth. Additionally, the targets for 2022 were discussed and adopted.

These DNNs will enable life insurers to replace old system generations, integrate artificial intelligence into their core functions, and modernize their systems. The project is part of msg life's response to the increasing relevance of artificial intelligence in the insurance industry.","///Retrieved document 0: In light of these developments, msg life anticipates that insurance companies will show a general interest in the software and consulting solutions it will be offering in 2022.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is also becoming increasingly relevant as a topic. The use of AI (and automated ma- chine learning at its heart) not only improves efficiency through automation, but also facilitates new technical approaches which in turn pave the way for entirely new business models, services and products. In connection with AI, insurers are also concentrating on robo-advis- ers, advanced analytics and blockchain.
For one, msg life is responding to this with the TRAIL.X project, where deep neural networks (DNNs) are being developed for the actuarial computation module in cooperation with the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. These DNNs will enable life insurers to replace old system generations, map their core functions with artificial intelligence and integrate them into a modern system.
Further development of products and services
msg life is pressing ahead with the further technical and functional optimisation and completion of its product range in the fields of life insurance and pensions. The necessary investments for this are being kept at a rela- tively normal level for a software company in the current year.
Continuous delivery, an important strategic element, will continue to be implemented in 2022 in order to further optimise the development process with and for customers.

tions with artificial intelligence and integrate them into a modern system. Actuarial functions will be transfer- able automatically with AI and connected to a modern policy administration system. Trustworthy AI and au- tomated machine learning are two topics that play an important role in this context.
The project breaks new technological ground and will create a fundamentally new hybrid technology at the point where machine learning, software development and actuarial mathematics intersect. The work ties in closely with the work in an ongoing migration project for an msg life customer and will be subsidised for three years by the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs, Re- gional Development and Energy (StMWi).
Business with existing customers in 2021 was charac- terised by extremely stable, successful projects as well as a continuous flow of new contracts. The company ex- pects these developments to continue in 2022.
msg life was able to achieve sales successes in almost every region in which the company operated in 2021:
In the German-speaking market, the contracts for a proof of concept relating to the potential rollout of msg. Insurance Suite were signed with a well-known life in- surer and, shortly after the end of the reporting period, a start-up life insurer. Furthermore, the long-standing customer HUK-Coburg awarded contracts to roll out msg.RAN and msg.Tax Data. Likewise, the company was awarded contracts to roll out msg.Tax Data from Öffent- liche Versicherung Braunschweig and AXA Lebensver- sicherung AG. ERGO also placed an order to introduce msg.Life Product, the mathematical component of msg. Life Factory.
msg life is also cultivating the Benelux market inten- sively from the German-speaking countries. After gain- ing AEGON in the Netherlands as a customer in 2020, msg life is generating interest there with its range of products, especially from insurance groups which op- erate nationally.

msg life promotes employees as part of its in-house ‘life talent’ programme. Using a structured selection process, employees are identified as talents if they are developing very quickly and positively and they have the potential to take on a strategic and leading role in the company in the future. Within the programme, the participants identify their own strategic topics, work in- dependently on questions and projects and take their results back to the company with the approval of the Management Board. In addition to individual support and professional development of the employees, the central goals of the programme, which starts on an annual basis, is good networking and long-term reten- tion of the talents in the company, as well as allowing knowledge to be transferred as broadly, quickly and pragmatically as possible, in particular with regard to new topics. Within this context, the practised reality of flat hierarchies at msg life is both the foundation as well as the target of the successful implementation of the programme. The talent programme will be expand- ed and extended with a high-potential programme from 2022 onwards.

1,The R & D expenditure of the msg life Group in the 2021 financial year was 11.195 million euros.,"///Retrieved document 0: The msg life Group does not conduct open-ended re- search, but instead focuses on purely target-oriented research. Special importance is attached to close com- munication with the market and customers as their as- sessment of the products’ relevance to business success is crucial. The msg life Group therefore attaches a great deal of importance to its cooperation with customers in the user and operator groups as well as with partners (IBM or the msg Group, for example) in relation to its most important products. The approaches devised with-
in the framework of research are presented, discussed and evaluated within the user and operator groups at an early stage and, if required, on a cross-product basis. The evaluation is conducted with particular regard to users’ interest in acquiring the product enhancements. In this way, new releases of standard software products are generally partially financed by advance orders from some of the customers.
As there are no user groups that can be accessed for the placement of new products or the opening up of new markets, early customer models are used which reward a customer’s early decision in favour of a new product with commercial benefits.
Purchasing R & D expertise
In its capacity as market leader in its core business, the msg life Group is usually unable to have recourse to ready-made external research findings. This particularly applies to specialist thematic areas in the customers’ sectors. As a sector-specific service provider, the com-
T N E M E G A N A M

pany prefers to rely on its own research, which builds upon its participation in trade conferences, association activities and joint projects with partner companies. Fu- ture trends, too, can usually be identified more reliably on the basis of the systematic reviewing of customer requirements from projects and canvassing situations than on the basis of external surveys. It goes without saying that the qualification level of the Group’s em- ployees is updated continuously by means of selective (also external) ongoing training activities. In the tech- nology sector, msg life makes use of rapidly develop- ing standards and non-proprietary technologies right
through to freely available open-source products. The company also safeguards the quality of its own techno- logical orientation by maintaining close partnerships with IBM and with selected colleges and universities.
R & D expenditure
The msg life Group’s R & D expenditure totalled 11.195 million euros in the 2021 financial year (previous year: 8.934 million euros). Once again, no development ex- penses were capitalised.

In the reporting year, current assets increased from 74.5 million euros in the previous year to 92.3 million euros.

Compared to the previous year, turnover decreased by 6.5 million euros from 56.5 million euros to 50.0 million euros. This development was driven by turnover from third parties which decreased by 9.4 million euros, and internal turnover (i.e. turnover from companies within the msg life Group) which increased by 2.9 million eu- ros.

In connection with its ongoing internationalisation strategy, msg life and IBM have entered into a partner- ship to open up new insurance markets. The goal is to significantly increase the competitiveness of interna- tional insurance companies through a fully digitised end-to-end solution, thereby securing their future.
In the past, the strategic presence of msg life in each foreign market was an important success factor when it came to attracting new customers. It is also becoming more and more apparent that Group companies want to put the solutions implemented for one region at the disposal of other Group companies in other countries – which can advance the ongoing internationalisation of msg life as a service provider for its customers. Besides the established partnership with IBM, the objective in the 2022 financial year is to press ahead with ma- jor sales projects, especially in the established foreign markets, as in the 2021 financial year.
The Benelux countries are an important market in this regard, where msg life, in cooperation with IBM, gained its largest new customer so far in AEGON in the Nether- lands, and is now working on the related introductory project.
The Austrian market is also a cornerstone of msg life’s international activities: msg life has enjoyed a number of highly significant successes there in recent years. The placement and further development of the consulting portfolio for the German-language markets and the mar- keting of msg life products in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe is carried out from Vienna. On the Swiss market, too, msg life sees good prospects for the further expansion of its business and is represent- ed with its own offices and by various well-known life insurers such as AXA and Schweizerische Mobiliar. An innovative, AI-based and previously unique migration solution developed by msg life will be used at AXA in 2023 in the context of the acquisition of the legacy port- folio.

With regard to the US market, msg life is currently exam- ining whether it would be possible to deploy a localised version of its portfolio of European life insurance prod- ucts in connection with its specific US products as an integrated solution. Overall, msg life continues to enjoy steady growth in the various insurance sectors in the US market and intends to exploit the potential for business that this represents. In addition to the implementation and integration of specific software products, the range of services offered by msg life encompasses a variety of consulting services in connection with product and tar- iff modelling, for example, as well as operator models – these are generating growing interest in the market.
The target group of the msg life Group company there is predominantly health and group insurers and, in fu- ture, will also include life insurers on the basis of the US product portfolio. The expansion and diversification of the company’s own range of solutions and partner- ships with specialised service providers are being used to unlock new customer groups. Now that the Biden ad- ministration has built on the Patient Protection and Af- fordable Care Act, msg life expects the state healthcare programmes such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid to grow further with the sales opportu- nities this provides. In the US market, msg life is also examining the potential for a commercial partnership in the field of health insurance.
Following an excellent 2021 financial year, msg life is registering a high level of demand for solutions in the first quarter of the current 2022 financial year – from insurance companies in Germany and other countries in equal measure. In this context, msg life also expects to see further regulation throughout the financial ser- vices sector. Be it the revision of Solvency II, the new international accounting standard IFRS 17, the Europe- an Transparency Directive, the rollout of a digital pen- sion overview or the introduction of PEPP, the ongoing implementation of numerous regulatory requirements necessitates comprehensive changes to the solutions which are currently used and ties up vast amounts of insurers’ resources. This means that the use of versatile, cost-effective standard software remains highly attrac- tive throughout the insurance industry.

///Retrieved document 1: Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the condensed management report and Group manage- ment report as a whole provide an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, are consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, comply with the German legal requirements and appropriately present the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the condensed management report and Group management re- port.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and with consideration for the German Generally Accepted Standards on Auditing as promulgated by the IDW will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably

be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and the condensed management report and Group management report.
We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism through- out the audit. We also:
— Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated finan- cial statements, condensed management report and Group management report, whether due to fraud or error, plan and perform audit procedures in response to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstate- ment resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control;
— Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit of the consoli- dated financial statements and of precautions and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the condensed management report and Group management report in order to plan audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these sys- tems;

In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information
— is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, condensed management report and Group management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or
— otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
Responsibility of the legal representatives and Supervisory Board for the consolidated financial statements, condensed management report and Group management report
The legal representatives are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated fi- nancial statements that comply, in all material respects, with German GAAP, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, financial and earnings position of the Group. In addition, the legal representatives are responsible for such internal controls as they have deemed necessary in line with German GAAP to enable the preparation of con- solidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the legal representatives are re- sponsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.
Furthermore, the legal representatives are responsible for the preparation of the con- densed management report and Group management report that, as a whole, provide an appropriate view of the Group’s position and are, in all material respects, consis- tent with the consolidated financial statements, comply with German legal require- ments, and appropriately present the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the legal representatives are responsible for such precautions and mea- sures (systems) as they deem necessary to enable the preparation of a condensed management report and Group management report that are consistent with the ap- plicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the condensed management report and Group man- agement report.
The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
Responsibility of the auditor for the audit of the consolidated financial statements, condensed management report and Group management report
