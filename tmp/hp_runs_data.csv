Capital is consolidated according to the purchase method of accounting.
Any difference remaining on the assets side after netting is recognised as goodwill on the assets side and amortised over its conventional useful life of five years.
There is no more goodwill to recognise in the 2021 financial year, following the decon- solidation of the shares in spheos GmbH & Co. KG, Munich, and spheos Verwaltungs GmbH, Munich, in the previous year.
Receivables and payables are offset in the consolidated financial statements by elim- inating the receivables and the corresponding payables between the companies in- cluded in the consolidated financial statements.

IV. Notes on the statement of financial position
1. Fixed assets
The development of fixed assets in the financial year and in the previous year, in- cluding their breakdown, is presented separately in the consolidated statement of changes in fixed assets (see Appendix to the notes).
The intangible assets are essentially software purchased from third parties.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over an expected useful life. The expected useful life of software purchased from third parties is between three and 15 years.
The disposal in the financial assets concerns an interest in ARGE FJA KR BU-System, Munich, which has not been consolidated. The msg life Group had few means of par- ticipating in the financial and business decision-making processes of the company and as such has no significant influence over the company.

According to the Global Economic Prospect Report published by the World Bank in January 2022, the global economy is in a distinct de- cline compounded by new variants of Covid-19 as well as high inflation, debt and income inequality, following a strong upturn in 2021. Economists expect the global growth rate to fall from 5.5 per cent in 2021 to 4.1 per cent this year. The World Bank expects it to increase by 3.2 per cent in 2023.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently down- graded the forecast it released last October in its up- dated World Economic Outlook in January 2022. The IMF expects the global economy to grow by just 4.4 per cent this year, following growth of 5.9 per cent last year – 0.5 per cent less than initially forecast. The IMF attributes this to the current Covid-19 situation, supply bottle- necks and the high rate of inflation. Like the World Bank, the IMF predicts growth of 3.2 per cent in 2023.

The aggregated economic sector of trade, transport, accommodation and food services saw growth of just 3.0 per cent. Fol- lowing growth of 3.8 per cent in 2020, the construction sector reported a slight decline of 0.4 per cent. Other services, which include culture, entertainment, sports and creative activities, were hit particularly hard by the crisis: Their economic performance grew by just 0.6 per cent, following a decline of 10.5 per cent in the same period in the previous year.
In 2021, foreign trade recovered from the dramatic set- back it suffered in 2020. Germany exported 9.4 per cent more goods and services abroad than in the same pe- riod in the previous year. Imports grew by 8.6 per cent. This means that foreign trade in 2021 was only slightly below the level it had reached in 2019.
