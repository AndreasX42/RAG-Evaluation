The shareholders\u2019 meeting is of the opinion that personal qualifications and ability, not gender, should be the decisive factor with regard to filling po- sitions on the Supervisory Board and among the man- aging directors.

On the other hand, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects the global economy to grow by 4.4% this year, downgrading its previous forecast. The IMF also predicts growth of 3.2% in 2023.

According to the Global Economic Prospect Report published by the World Bank in January 2022, the global economy is in a distinct de- cline compounded by new variants of Covid-19 as well as high inflation, debt and income inequality, following a strong upturn in 2021. Economists expect the global growth rate to fall from 5.5 per cent in 2021 to 4.1 per cent this year. The World Bank expects it to increase by 3.2 per cent in 2023.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently down- graded the forecast it released last October in its up- dated World Economic Outlook in January 2022. The IMF expects the global economy to grow by just 4.4 per cent this year, following growth of 5.9 per cent last year \u2013 0.5 per cent less than initially forecast. The IMF attributes this to the current Covid-19 situation, supply bottle- necks and the high rate of inflation. Like the World Bank, the IMF predicts growth of 3.2 per cent in 2023.\n\nThe IMF has downgraded its forecast by 1.2 percentage points to 4 per cent for the USA this year, the world\u2019s largest economy. The IMF has even downgraded its fore- cast by 0.8 percentage points to 4.8 per cent for China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nAccording to the IMF, the dramatic rise in inflation will remain high in 2022 due to ongoing supply difficulties and high energy prices. The organisation expects in- dustrialised nations to see an average inflation rate of 3.9 per cent. The average rate of inflation in developing countries and emerging economies is expected to be 5.9 per cent.\n\ndustry.

The forecasts of the OECD (Organisa- tion for Economic Co-operation and Development) are somewhat more optimistic: The experts expect growth of 5.2 per cent in the previous year and 4.3 per cent in 2022. According to the experts, new variants of Covid-19 and insufficient rates of vaccination are just two factors that represent risks. Additionally, economic stimulus packages are running out and corrections are looming on the property markets.\n\nAccording to the calculations of the Federal Statistical Office, Germany\u2019s GDP grew by 2.8 per cent in 2021 after having fallen by 4.6 per cent in the same period in the previous year. \u2018After economic performance had increased again last summer despite growing delivery bottlenecks and material shortages, the recovery of the German economy came to a halt at the end of the year due to the fourth Covid-19 wave and another reinforce- ment of Covid-19 preventive measures\u2019, reported the Federal Statistical Office in January 2022. Compared to the crisis in 2020, economic performance improved in almost every area in 2021. However, it has not yet reached its pre-crisis level.\n\nThe economic performance of the manufacturing sector improved by 4.4 per cent year-on-year. The aggregated economic sector of trade, transport, accommodation and food services saw growth of just 3.0 per cent. Fol- lowing growth of 3.8 per cent in 2020, the construction sector reported a slight decline of 0.4 per cent. Other services, which include culture, entertainment, sports and creative activities, were hit particularly hard by the crisis: Their economic performance grew by just 0.6 per cent, following a decline of 10.5 per cent in the same period in the previous year.\n\nIn 2021, foreign trade recovered from the dramatic set- back it suffered in 2020. Germany exported 9.4 per cent more goods and services abroad than in the same pe- riod in the previous year. Imports grew by 8.6 per cent. This means that foreign trade in 2021 was only slightly below the level it had reached in 2019."

He announced that insurers reported an increase in premiums of 1.1 per cent (previous year: 1.6 per cent) across all segments, reaching 223.4 billion euros.\n\nThe outlook for 2022 is cautiously optimistic. Accord- ing to the GDV, the industry expects premium growth of between 2 and 3 per cent. With regard to life insur- ance, the Covid-19 pandemic can be expected to have an impact on business prospects in the current year too. Premium growth of between 1 and 2 per cent could be considered realistic here. The GDV expects a weaker performance from traditional life insurance products, although market-oriented products are expected to grow more strongly. \u2018The decisive factors here are the economic prospects of private households and the gen- eral political conditions for private old-age pensions in the current legislative period\u2019, said Weiler."

Additionally, the industry has built up additional interest reserves to mitigate the risks of their long-term interest guarantees. Moody's, a rating agency, has upgraded its outlook for the sector from negative to stable, indicating that the pressure on life insurance is gradually lifting.

That amount is 1.4 per cent lower than in 2020. Whereas current pre- mium income increased slightly to 65.3 billion euros, one-time premiums declined to 36.5 billion euros (-4.7 per cent).\n\nAccording to the GDV, new Riester business performed well with growth of 12 per cent to 310,500 contracts. The portfolio largely remained stable, with around 10.4 mil- lion contracts. With regard to basic pensions, the num- ber of newly brokered policies increased by almost 40 per cent to 119,000 contracts. This caused the overall portfolio to grow by 4 per cent to 2.5 million contracts.\n\nThe rating agency Moody\u2019s is confident about German life insurers: \u2018The pressure on life insurance is lifting gradually\u2019, said Christian Badorff, a credit analyst at Moody\u2019s, according to the business newspaper Han- delsblatt in October 2021. Although the industry is still under pressure in 2022 due to low interest rates, it is set to stabilise. Moody\u2019s has upgraded its outlook for the sector from negative to stable. Life insurers are increas- ingly shifting new business to products that protect cap- ital, it continues. Additionally, the additional interest reserves have suppressed the risks of their long-term interest guarantees.\n\nThe persistently low interest rates were a concern of the insurance industry in the 2021 financial year as well. The ECB launched a multi-billion-euro emergen- cy purchase programme in March 2020 to mitigate the severe economic impacts of the Covid-19 crisis: under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), the ECB will purchase up to 1.85 billion euros\u2019 worth of government and corporate bonds until March 2022 at the earliest.\n\nIn September 2021, the ECB decided to reduce the rate of PEPP purchases moderately. The ECB announced its decision at the most recent ECB meeting on 3 February 2022. At the same time, the ECB left the key interest rate in the Eurozone at 0 per cent, while the deposit facili- ty rate also remained unchanged at -0.5 per cent. This means that banks must continue to pay penalty rates if they deposit surplus money with the ECB."

As such, the ECB is prepared to ad- just all available instruments in order to reach its 2 per cent inflation target in the medium term. Lagarde made an announcement to this effect at the press conference afterwards. According to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, the rate of inflation in Eurozone countries rose from 5.0 per cent in December 2021 to 5.1 per cent in January 2022. High energy costs were the main driver. According to the Federal Statistical Office, inflation in Germany fell to 4.9 per cent in January 2022 from 5.3 per cent in the previous month.\n\nIn light of interest rates having remained low for years, the Federal Ministry of Finance decided in March 2021 to lower the projected interest rate for new life insur- ance contracts from 0.9 per cent to 0.25 per cent from 1 January 2022 onwards. The German actuarial associ- ation Deutsche Aktuarvereinigung (DAV) had called for this to happen numerous times, as extensive premium guarantees were no longer reasonable from an actuari- al standpoint due to the persistently low interest rates. In November last year, the DAV also recommended that this level remain in place until 2023: \u2018We do not current- ly see signs of a noticeable recovery in interest rates in the near future, not least in light of the economic uncer- tainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic\u2019, said Herbert Schneidemann, chairman of the DAV, to support the recommendation.\n\nFor this reason, more and more insurers are developing new products with different guarantee models, moving away from traditional policies with guaranteed interest in the process. In the financial year ended, some insur- ers even abandoned the 100 per cent premium guar- antee completely. They only offer a complete premium guarantee where they are required by law to do so.\n\nRegulatory matters were also high on the list of insurers\u2019 priorities in the financial year ended. Be it the Europe- an Transparency Directive, the revision of Solvency II or the introduction of new international financial reporting rules (IFRS 17), the implementation of statutory regula- tions has made it necessary to make extensive adjust- ments.
