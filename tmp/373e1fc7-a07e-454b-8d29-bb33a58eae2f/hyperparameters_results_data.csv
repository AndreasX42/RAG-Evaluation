///Retrieved document 2: Under the more difficult conditions of the Covid-19 pan- demic, the German insurance industry closed the 2021 financial year with a ‘solid’ performance, concludes Wolfgang Weiler, president of the Gesamtverband der Deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft (GDV), at its annual media conference in January 2022. He announced that insurers reported an increase in premiums of 1.1 per cent (previous year: 1.6 per cent) across all segments, reaching 223.4 billion euros.
The outlook for 2022 is cautiously optimistic. Accord- ing to the GDV, the industry expects premium growth of between 2 and 3 per cent. With regard to life insur- ance, the Covid-19 pandemic can be expected to have an impact on business prospects in the current year too. Premium growth of between 1 and 2 per cent could be considered realistic here. The GDV expects a weaker performance from traditional life insurance products, although market-oriented products are expected to grow more strongly. ‘The decisive factors here are the economic prospects of private households and the gen- eral political conditions for private old-age pensions in the current legislative period’, said Weiler.

1,"The low interest rates have put pressure on the German life insurance industry. However, Moody's expects the pressure to gradually lift and the industry to stabilize. Life insurers are shifting new business to products that protect capital and the additional interest reserves have helped suppress the risks of long-term interest guarantees.","///Retrieved document 0: The rating agency Moody’s is confident about German life insurers: ‘The pressure on life insurance is lifting gradually’, said Christian Badorff, a credit analyst at Moody’s, according to the business newspaper Han- delsblatt in October 2021. Although the industry is still under pressure in 2022 due to low interest rates, it is set to stabilise. Moody’s has upgraded its outlook for the sector from negative to stable. Life insurers are increas- ingly shifting new business to products that protect cap- ital, it continues. Additionally, the additional interest reserves have suppressed the risks of their long-term interest guarantees.
The persistently low interest rates were a concern of the insurance industry in the 2021 financial year as well. The ECB launched a multi-billion-euro emergen- cy purchase programme in March 2020 to mitigate the severe economic impacts of the Covid-19 crisis: under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), the ECB will purchase up to 1.85 billion euros’ worth of government and corporate bonds until March 2022 at the earliest.
In September 2021, the ECB decided to reduce the rate of PEPP purchases moderately. The ECB announced its decision at the most recent ECB meeting on 3 February 2022. At the same time, the ECB left the key interest rate in the Eurozone at 0 per cent, while the deposit facili- ty rate also remained unchanged at -0.5 per cent. This means that banks must continue to pay penalty rates if they deposit surplus money with the ECB.

///Retrieved document 1: The outlook for 2022 is cautiously optimistic. Accord- ing to the GDV, the industry expects premium growth of between 2 and 3 per cent. With regard to life insur- ance, the Covid-19 pandemic can be expected to have an impact on business prospects in the current year too. Premium growth of between 1 and 2 per cent could be considered realistic here. The GDV expects a weaker performance from traditional life insurance products, although market-oriented products are expected to grow more strongly. ‘The decisive factors here are the economic prospects of private households and the gen- eral political conditions for private old-age pensions in the current legislative period’, said Weiler.
The GDV goes on to report that the premium income of life insurers and pension funds amounted to around 102 billion euros in the financial year ended. That amount is 1.4 per cent lower than in 2020. Whereas current pre- mium income increased slightly to 65.3 billion euros, one-time premiums declined to 36.5 billion euros (-4.7 per cent).
According to the GDV, new Riester business performed well with growth of 12 per cent to 310,500 contracts. The portfolio largely remained stable, with around 10.4 mil- lion contracts. With regard to basic pensions, the num- ber of newly brokered policies increased by almost 40 per cent to 119,000 contracts. This caused the overall portfolio to grow by 4 per cent to 2.5 million contracts.

///Retrieved document 2: In light of the rapid rise in inflation, ECB President Christine Lagarde refused to rule out an interest rate increase this year. As such, the ECB is prepared to ad- just all available instruments in order to reach its 2 per cent inflation target in the medium term. Lagarde made an announcement to this effect at the press conference afterwards. According to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, the rate of inflation in Eurozone countries rose from 5.0 per cent in December 2021 to 5.1 per cent in January 2022. High energy costs were the main driver. According to the Federal Statistical Office, inflation in Germany fell to 4.9 per cent in January 2022 from 5.3 per cent in the previous month.
In light of interest rates having remained low for years, the Federal Ministry of Finance decided in March 2021 to lower the projected interest rate for new life insur- ance contracts from 0.9 per cent to 0.25 per cent from 1 January 2022 onwards. The German actuarial associ- ation Deutsche Aktuarvereinigung (DAV) had called for this to happen numerous times, as extensive premium guarantees were no longer reasonable from an actuari- al standpoint due to the persistently low interest rates. In November last year, the DAV also recommended that this level remain in place until 2023: ‘We do not current- ly see signs of a noticeable recovery in interest rates in the near future, not least in light of the economic uncer- tainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic’, said Herbert Schneidemann, chairman of the DAV, to support the recommendation.

Macroeconomic and sector-specific conditions
At the time of writing of the condensed management report and Group management report, the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 on the general economic and sector-specific conditions in the current 2022 financial year and beyond was not yet evident and has therefore not been taken into account in the follow- ing disclosures regarding both subject areas.
The Covid-19 pandemic continues to overshadow in- ternational economic activity. According to the Global Economic Prospect Report published by the World Bank in January 2022, the global economy is in a distinct de- cline compounded by new variants of Covid-19 as well as high inflation, debt and income inequality, following a strong upturn in 2021. Economists expect the global growth rate to fall from 5.5 per cent in 2021 to 4.1 per cent this year. The World Bank expects it to increase by 3.2 per cent in 2023.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently down- graded the forecast it released last October in its up- dated World Economic Outlook in January 2022. The IMF expects the global economy to grow by just 4.4 per cent this year, following growth of 5.9 per cent last year – 0.5 per cent less than initially forecast. The IMF attributes this to the current Covid-19 situation, supply bottle- necks and the high rate of inflation. Like the World Bank, the IMF predicts growth of 3.2 per cent in 2023.

As such, the ECB is prepared to ad- just all available instruments in order to reach its 2 per cent inflation target in the medium term. Lagarde made an announcement to this effect at the press conference afterwards. According to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, the rate of inflation in Eurozone countries rose from 5.0 per cent in December 2021 to 5.1 per cent in January 2022. High energy costs were the main driver. According to the Federal Statistical Office, inflation in Germany fell to 4.9 per cent in January 2022 from 5.3 per cent in the previous month.
In light of interest rates having remained low for years, the Federal Ministry of Finance decided in March 2021 to lower the projected interest rate for new life insur- ance contracts from 0.9 per cent to 0.25 per cent from 1 January 2022 onwards. The German actuarial associ- ation Deutsche Aktuarvereinigung (DAV) had called for this to happen numerous times, as extensive premium guarantees were no longer reasonable from an actuari- al standpoint due to the persistently low interest rates. In November last year, the DAV also recommended that this level remain in place until 2023: ‘We do not current- ly see signs of a noticeable recovery in interest rates in the near future, not least in light of the economic uncer- tainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic’, said Herbert Schneidemann, chairman of the DAV, to support the recommendation.

///Retrieved document 1: The rating agency Moody’s is confident about German life insurers: ‘The pressure on life insurance is lifting gradually’, said Christian Badorff, a credit analyst at Moody’s, according to the business newspaper Han- delsblatt in October 2021. Although the industry is still under pressure in 2022 due to low interest rates, it is set to stabilise. Moody’s has upgraded its outlook for the sector from negative to stable. Life insurers are increas- ingly shifting new business to products that protect cap- ital, it continues. Additionally, the additional interest reserves have suppressed the risks of their long-term interest guarantees.
The persistently low interest rates were a concern of the insurance industry in the 2021 financial year as well. The ECB launched a multi-billion-euro emergen- cy purchase programme in March 2020 to mitigate the severe economic impacts of the Covid-19 crisis: under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), the ECB will purchase up to 1.85 billion euros’ worth of government and corporate bonds until March 2022 at the earliest.
In September 2021, the ECB decided to reduce the rate of PEPP purchases moderately. The ECB announced its decision at the most recent ECB meeting on 3 February 2022. At the same time, the ECB left the key interest rate in the Eurozone at 0 per cent, while the deposit facili- ty rate also remained unchanged at -0.5 per cent. This means that banks must continue to pay penalty rates if they deposit surplus money with the ECB.
