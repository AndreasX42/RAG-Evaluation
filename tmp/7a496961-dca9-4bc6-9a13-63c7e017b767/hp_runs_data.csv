Besides decisions requiring consent, the Supervisory Board always discussed the current indicators of the earnings, financial and assets position of the msg life Group at each meeting. Additionally, the Management Board reported to the Supervisory Board on other im- portant projects including, for example, the current sales and project situations in the individual divisions, the general development of the national and interna- tional market climates, short and longer-term corporate strategy as well as possible cooperative ventures.
ACTIVITIES OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD IN THE 2021 FINANCIAL YEAR
The Supervisory Board met five times in the 2021 finan- cial year. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, four meetings were held as teleconferences; the meeting on 23 Sep- tember 2021 was held in person. All members of the Supervisory Board were present at every meeting and for every resolution.
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE SUPERVISORY BOARD AND MANAGEMENT BOARD
All significant matters of relevance to the company were always reported to the Supervisory Board promptly and comprehensively. The Management Board also in- formed the Supervisory Board of any events of particu- lar note during periods between meetings.
The Supervisory Board received detailed reports from the Management Board in preparation for each meet- ing. In performing its functions and work, the Supervi- sory Board drew on the written and verbal information provided by the members of the Management Board; written and verbal information was also provided by the auditor with regard to the audit of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements for the 2020 financial year.
To prepare for their decisions, the members of the Su- pervisory Board were provided with detailed reports by the Management Board in advance. In these documents, the Management Board provided the Supervisory Board with monthly details of the key performance indicators, with any deviations from plans being explained in de- tail.
Additionally, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board was in constant contact with the Management Board – especially the Chairman of the Management Board – and inquired about current business developments and important transactions.

msg life was able to achieve sales successes in almost every region in which the company operated in 2021:
In the German-speaking market, the contracts for a proof of concept relating to the potential rollout of msg. Insurance Suite were signed with a well-known life in- surer and, shortly after the end of the reporting period, a start-up life insurer. Furthermore, the long-standing customer HUK-Coburg awarded contracts to roll out msg.RAN and msg.Tax Data. Likewise, the company was awarded contracts to roll out msg.Tax Data from Öffent- liche Versicherung Braunschweig and AXA Lebensver- sicherung AG. ERGO also placed an order to introduce msg.Life Product, the mathematical component of msg. Life Factory.
msg life is also cultivating the Benelux market inten- sively from the German-speaking countries. After gain- ing AEGON in the Netherlands as a customer in 2020, msg life is generating interest there with its range of products, especially from insurance groups which op- erate nationally.
The business of msg life in the United States for primar- ily health and group insurers was satisfactory up to the end of the reporting period. FJA-US, Inc. – the msg life Group company located in the United States – record- ed continuous successful development with solutions such as the Unified Distribution Platform, the Unified Product Platform and the web-based multi-channel platform msg.Sales. In the 2021 financial year, the com- pany attracted two new, well-known customers from the health and life insurance segments and recorded over- all growth in customer demand for services.

///Retrieved document 1: In terms of credit risk, the Group is only exposed to risk in relation to trade receivables. Adequate valuation al- lowances have been made to cover the estimated de- fault risk. As the credit rating of clients in the insurance industry is generally good, the receivables are not in- sured. The maximum default risk is in principle equiva- lent to the nominal values less the valuation allowances. There is no other loan collateral and there are no other risk-mitigating agreements (such as guarantees, land charges or pledges) in place. Usage reservations exist until payment is complete. For invoiced receivables, the net balance of additions to and reversals of valuation allowances was 819,000 euros (previous year: 14,000 euros). On each effective date, trade receivables do not include any carrying amounts for which terms have been renegotiated and which would otherwise be over- due.

The potential risks to the msg life Group associated with financial instruments consist notably of liquidity risks – which can result in a company being unable to raise the funds needed to settle its financial liabilities – currency risks resulting from its activities in various currency ar- eas, default risks arising from the non-fulfilment of con- tractual obligations by contracting parties and interest rate risks caused by movements in the market interest rate leading to a change in the fair value of a financial instrument and interest-related cash flow risks, which lead to a change in the future cash flows of a financial instrument due to changes in market interest rates.
Organisation:
The company has organised its risk management pro- cess along clear, functional lines. Specific tasks have been assigned to the individual organisational units involved in the risk management process. More infor- mation is available under ‘General’ in this section.
There are no default risks in relation to cash and cash equivalents. These are invested at banks with good rat- ings.

///Retrieved document 2: For the most part, the operating companies of the Group carry out their business activities in their respective countries. The Group – with the exception of the United States – is therefore not exposed to any significant cur- rency risks in its operating business. A total of 90 per cent of its revenues are generated in eurozone countries (previous year: 87 per cent), and the remainder in Swit- zerland and the United States. The currency risk on the asset side in relation to trade receivables comes from receivables not denominated in euros, accounting for 15 per cent (previous year: 13 per cent). In the case of trade payables, currency risks occur in relation to the 3 per cent of liabilities not denominated in euros (previ- ous year: 5 per cent). Differences arising from currency conversion of financial statements from a foreign cur- rency to the Group currency for the creation of consol- idated financial statements do not affect currency risk because the respective changes in foreign currency are recognised under equity with no effect on income.
Market risks:
Market risks result from changes in market prices. These cause the fair values of financial instruments or future cash flows relating to them to fluctuate. Market risks encompass interest rate, currency and other price risks (such as commodity prices and share prices).
Price risks:
The msg life Group is not exposed to any price risks.
Information on risk concentration (concentration risks):
The company does not have any dependencies on the procurement side. On the sales side, there tend to be concentrations of risk due to the geographic distribu- tion of turnover. For example, Germany accounts for an 88.8 per cent share of turnover (previous year: 85.0 per cent).
Interest rate risks:
Interest rate risks result from a fluctuation in the fair val- ue or future cash flows of a financial instrument due to changes in market interest rates.
Within trade receivables, there is no significant con- centration on individual customers. In the year under review, the ten largest customers accounted for a 64.0 per cent share of turnover (previous year: 61.1 per cent) and a 33.7 per cent share of trade receivables (previous year: 37.9 per cent).

They prioritize target-oriented research and close communication with market and customers to assess the relevance of their products. They also emphasize cooperation with customers and partners in the development process.","///Retrieved document 0: Focus of R & D activities
For msg life, research and development (R & D) serves not only to develop and expand standard software solu- tions, but also to extend its consulting expertise. Such expertise manifests itself in the strategic development of employee know-how, as well as in the further de- velopment of software tools that give efficient support to the consulting activities. Needless to say, all R & D activities are subject to the imperative of sustainable cost-efficiency.
The msg life Group does not conduct open-ended re- search, but instead focuses on purely target-oriented research. Special importance is attached to close com- munication with the market and customers as their as- sessment of the products’ relevance to business success is crucial. The msg life Group therefore attaches a great deal of importance to its cooperation with customers in the user and operator groups as well as with partners (IBM or the msg Group, for example) in relation to its most important products. The approaches devised with-
in the framework of research are presented, discussed and evaluated within the user and operator groups at an early stage and, if required, on a cross-product basis. The evaluation is conducted with particular regard to users’ interest in acquiring the product enhancements. In this way, new releases of standard software products are generally partially financed by advance orders from some of the customers.
As there are no user groups that can be accessed for the placement of new products or the opening up of new markets, early customer models are used which reward a customer’s early decision in favour of a new product with commercial benefits.
Purchasing R & D expertise
In its capacity as market leader in its core business, the msg life Group is usually unable to have recourse to ready-made external research findings. This particularly applies to specialist thematic areas in the customers’ sectors. As a sector-specific service provider, the com-
20
pany prefers to rely on its own research, which builds upon its participation in trade conferences, association activities and joint projects with partner companies. Fu- ture trends, too, can usually be identified more reliably on the basis of the systematic reviewing of customer requirements from projects and canvassing situations than on the basis of external surveys. It goes without saying that the qualification level of the Group’s em- ployees is updated continuously by means of selective (also external) ongoing training activities. In the tech- nology sector, msg life makes use of rapidly develop- ing standards and non-proprietary technologies right

which applicants are asked individual interview ques- tions in videos and are able to respond with their own recorded answers.
For the company, the 2021 financial year was again overshadowed by the restrictions on working in offices and on customers’ premises due to the pandemic, as well as the extremely high percentage of employees who worked from home. As the company was able to master this decentralised way of working largely with- out issue in the second year of the pandemic, it has laid a robust cornerstone for the future of work organisation at msg life. The company took the various services it of- fers to support employees and their families further in 2021, and made further improvements to this field with a service provider and its extensive range of options and services.
The onboarding process for new employees was almost exclusively remote and digitised in 2021. msg life has been holding welcome and introductory events for all new employees for years. In the course of these on- boarding sessions, the strategic orientation of the com- pany is presented, as well as its targets in each field of business. The aim is also to give the new colleagues a broad network within the entire company as quickly as possible. In 2021, msg life took on the challenge of sup- porting new employees with a structured onboarding scheme. Innovative online collaboration formats, which are now well established, advanced and more profes- sional, were used for these purposes.

In connection with its ongoing internationalisation strategy, msg life and IBM have entered into a partner- ship to open up new insurance markets. The goal is to significantly increase the competitiveness of interna- tional insurance companies through a fully digitised end-to-end solution, thereby securing their future.
In the past, the strategic presence of msg life in each foreign market was an important success factor when it came to attracting new customers. It is also becoming more and more apparent that Group companies want to put the solutions implemented for one region at the disposal of other Group companies in other countries – which can advance the ongoing internationalisation of msg life as a service provider for its customers. Besides the established partnership with IBM, the objective in the 2022 financial year is to press ahead with ma- jor sales projects, especially in the established foreign markets, as in the 2021 financial year.
With regard to the US market, msg life is currently exam- ining whether it would be possible to deploy a localised version of its portfolio of European life insurance prod- ucts in connection with its specific US products as an integrated solution. Overall, msg life continues to enjoy steady growth in the various insurance sectors in the US market and intends to exploit the potential for business that this represents. In addition to the implementation and integration of specific software products, the range of services offered by msg life encompasses a variety of consulting services in connection with product and tar- iff modelling, for example, as well as operator models – these are generating growing interest in the market.

General
All the following estimations regarding opportunities and risks were made on the reporting date, 31 Decem- ber 2021.
In the type of business it conducts, the msg life Group is exposed to a large number of uncertainties which, if realised, can affect the Group’s earnings, financial and assets position, and that of the company, either posi- tively or negatively, or result in msg life falling short of or exceeding the targets it has set itself for the future development of its business.

Besides decisions requiring consent, the Supervisory Board always discussed the current indicators of the earnings, financial and assets position of the msg life Group at each meeting. Additionally, the Management Board reported to the Supervisory Board on other im- portant projects including, for example, the current sales and project situations in the individual divisions, the general development of the national and interna- tional market climates, short and longer-term corporate strategy as well as possible cooperative ventures.
ACTIVITIES OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD IN THE 2021 FINANCIAL YEAR
The Supervisory Board met five times in the 2021 finan- cial year. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, four meetings were held as teleconferences; the meeting on 23 Sep- tember 2021 was held in person. All members of the Supervisory Board were present at every meeting and for every resolution.
COOPERATION BETWEEN THE SUPERVISORY BOARD AND MANAGEMENT BOARD
All significant matters of relevance to the company were always reported to the Supervisory Board promptly and comprehensively. The Management Board also in- formed the Supervisory Board of any events of particu- lar note during periods between meetings.
The Supervisory Board received detailed reports from the Management Board in preparation for each meet- ing. In performing its functions and work, the Supervi- sory Board drew on the written and verbal information provided by the members of the Management Board; written and verbal information was also provided by the auditor with regard to the audit of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements for the 2020 financial year.
To prepare for their decisions, the members of the Su- pervisory Board were provided with detailed reports by the Management Board in advance. In these documents, the Management Board provided the Supervisory Board with monthly details of the key performance indicators, with any deviations from plans being explained in de- tail.
Additionally, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board was in constant contact with the Management Board – especially the Chairman of the Management Board – and inquired about current business developments and important transactions.

Liquidity risks:
Managing liquidity risk includes ensuring that the com- pany always has sufficient liquid funds or credit lines available to enable it to meet its payment obligations and hedge against risks resulting from fluctuations in payment flows. Among other things, the payment ob- ligations consist of interest and redemption payments. Liquidity risk also includes the risk of not being able to obtain sufficient liquidity at the expected terms when required (refinancing risk).
Under the management mechanisms now in place, the daily holdings of cash and cash equivalents and the monthly rolling financial plans are monitored by the company’s management. The purpose of liquidity man- agement is to finance predictable deficits at standard market terms under normal market conditions. This

means that losses from both borrowing capital at exces- sive interest rates as well as investing surplus funds at interest rates below the market level should be avoided.
Because of the company’s large holdings of cash and cash equivalents, the msg life Group considers the li- quidity risk to be low at present. The msg life Group has sufficient liquid funds to enable it to service its financial liabilities.
In addition, as at the reporting date, there are cred- it lines with banks amounting to 7.5 million euros, of which 1.560 million euros had been used at the report- ing date for security deposits.

The corresponding risk report for 2021 was presented to the Supervisory Board in Febru- ary 2022.
In 2021, the msg life Group’s profile did not change sig- nificantly with regard to the main types of opportunity and risk areas to which it is exposed. Below, individual types of risk that are identified as being important are explained in greater detail. The specification of these risks does not imply that other risks which have not been mentioned will not have a significant impact on msg life’s earnings, financial and assets position.
Among the Management Board’s most important tasks in the overall management of the Group are, in close coordination with the Supervisory Board, laying down general conditions and processes of risk management for the msg life Group, monitoring the degree of com- pliance with them and, in conjunction with the heads of the operating units and the administrative departments, regularly analysing the development of risks in the re- spective segments.
The msg life Group’s risk management system is docu- mented in a risk manual. One employee in the holding company’s Organisation & IT Services division has been appointed risk manager of the Group and is thereby en- trusted with submitting the prevailing risk management system to regular internal evaluation and documenting this process. It is the responsibility of the managers of the individual divisions to continuously monitor and deal with the risks to which their own divisions are ex- posed.
The foundation of good risk management is the reliable and prompt provision of the management with relevant information about the course of business. For this pur- pose, msg life has set up a monthly controlling and re- porting system.
The early risk detection system of msg life ag proved successful in 2021 as well and it was not necessary to revisit it. The entire procedure is described in the risk management manual and was approved by the Risk Board (risk manager and Management Board). The em- ployees responsible for this field were trained accord- ingly. As part of the ongoing ISO 27001 certification project, the management of information security risks has been expanded further within the overriding central risk management system.

Product- and service-specific opportunities
In addition, msg life’s employees are crucial to the company’s innovative power and the customers’ value added – and are therefore instrumental in the growth and profitability of the msg life Group as a whole. More information about the future opportunities being gener- ated by msg life’s employees can be found in the ‘Em- ployees’ chapter within this condensed management report and Group management report.
Like all software products, the msg life Group’s pro- ducts can have defects whose elimination under guar- antee increases costs and thereby influences the profit margin or even leads to compensation claims against the msg life Group. The msg life companies generally assume the warranty which is customary in the indus- try. As far as possible, liability obligations are limited contractually to the legal minimum and are secured with appropriate liability insurance policies. It can neverthe- less not be entirely ruled out that contractually agreed limitations on liability will be regarded as invalid and the existing insurance cover will be available to an in- sufficient extent or not at all – even if this is improbable.

msg life regards the continuation of regulation through- out the insurance sector as a direct consequence of the financial crisis. Like the ongoing low-interest phase, this regulation is necessitating a great deal of adapta- tion with regard to the solutions currently used in the insurance sector and is reinforcing the trend towards the use of standard software and cross-sector platform solutions – such as those offered by msg life. At this time, the situation in the insurance market is proving to be an opportunity for the company, as demonstrated by the new contracts over the past few years and current sales projects.
In the past, the Group company FJA-US, Inc. profited from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) which was enacted in 2013 in terms of both turnover and earnings. After the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act suffered from a lack of support from the Trump administration, the Biden administra- tion pressed on with an improvement to the Patient Pro- tection and Affordable Care Act in late 2021 in the form of the Build Back Better Act. As a result, state healthcare programmes such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid can be expected to grow further. Thanks to its now well-established partnerships with leading providers such as Companion Data Services, the msg life Group company in the USA can offer end-to-end ser- vices including claims handling. Additionally, the com- pany successfully expanded its related activities in the health and group insurance market and further diversi- fied its range of services.

In the past, the strategic presence of msg life in each foreign market was an important success factor when it came to attracting new customers. It is also becoming more and more apparent that Group companies want to put the solutions implemented for one region at the disposal of other Group companies in other countries – which can advance the ongoing internationalisation of msg life as a service provider for its customers. Besides the established partnership with IBM, the objective in the 2022 financial year is to press ahead with ma- jor sales projects, especially in the established foreign markets, as in the 2021 financial year.
With regard to the US market, msg life is currently exam- ining whether it would be possible to deploy a localised version of its portfolio of European life insurance prod- ucts in connection with its specific US products as an integrated solution. Overall, msg life continues to enjoy steady growth in the various insurance sectors in the US market and intends to exploit the potential for business that this represents. In addition to the implementation and integration of specific software products, the range of services offered by msg life encompasses a variety of consulting services in connection with product and tar- iff modelling, for example, as well as operator models – these are generating growing interest in the market.

///Retrieved document 2: Business with existing customers in 2021 was charac- terised by extremely stable, successful projects as well as a continuous flow of new contracts. The company ex- pects these developments to continue in 2022.
msg life was able to achieve sales successes in almost every region in which the company operated in 2021:
In the German-speaking market, the contracts for a proof of concept relating to the potential rollout of msg. Insurance Suite were signed with a well-known life in- surer and, shortly after the end of the reporting period, a start-up life insurer. Furthermore, the long-standing customer HUK-Coburg awarded contracts to roll out msg.RAN and msg.Tax Data. Likewise, the company was awarded contracts to roll out msg.Tax Data from Öffent- liche Versicherung Braunschweig and AXA Lebensver- sicherung AG. ERGO also placed an order to introduce msg.Life Product, the mathematical component of msg. Life Factory.
msg life is also cultivating the Benelux market inten- sively from the German-speaking countries. After gain- ing AEGON in the Netherlands as a customer in 2020, msg life is generating interest there with its range of products, especially from insurance groups which op- erate nationally.
The business of msg life in the United States for primar- ily health and group insurers was satisfactory up to the end of the reporting period. FJA-US, Inc. – the msg life Group company located in the United States – record- ed continuous successful development with solutions such as the Unified Distribution Platform, the Unified Product Platform and the web-based multi-channel platform msg.Sales. In the 2021 financial year, the com- pany attracted two new, well-known customers from the health and life insurance segments and recorded over- all growth in customer demand for services.

///Retrieved document 2: In terms of the conventional capital accumulation pro- ducts, modifications of the guarantees are dominant, for example through the use of current calculation guidelines or by dispensing with the annual interest guarantee. With the biometric products, too, there is a great deal of action on the market. Dynamic hybrid products have become the standard now and there is a continuous flow of innovative products in addition to them which allow, for example, investment in funds, but also the purchasing of options on the basis of tra- ditional basic cover. Insurance companies at the larger end of the scale in particular are offering products for old-age provision with capital guarantees on the basis of unit-linked approaches with investment guarantees.
Given the current challenges, microservice-oriented ar- chitectures designed to quickly support modified busi- ness models and high system versatility for the rapid in- troduction of innovative products are factors crucial to the success of insurance companies. The developments in insurance products described above are typically not associated with particular product families. The plat- form economy is also playing a key role in the insurance industry this year: numerous insurers are now using platforms and ecosystems to provide digital products and services beyond what had previously been their core business – this in turn is opening up new ways to create value.
For larger insurance companies, the acquisition of closed insurance contract portfolios that are no lon- ger available for sale (‘run-off’ portfolios) from mainly smaller insurance companies remains an important fac- tor. This enables the latter to generate positive effects for their books, and buyers can generate significant economies of scale and cost synergies. Modern asset management with modern and powerful IT systems plays a decisive role in this regard as well in the more efficient management of contracts.

This has led to a concentration and therefore an increase in market development risks. At the same time, this increases the company’s profitabil- ity. msg life will therefore attempt to persevere with its existing strategy, including in its current product seg- ments and regional markets, and to cover entire value chains and product ranges with its solutions. In this way, it hopes to achieve a decisive competitive advantage on the market, particularly vis-à-vis new competitors with aggressive pricing policies.
msg life is currently interested in expanding its market position in German-speaking countries and internation- ally, primarily through organic growth. This can also be supported in parallel by strategic acquisitions. The suc- cess of an acquisition is dependent upon whether the acquired company can be successfully integrated in the Group structure and the desired synergy effects can be generated.
Liquidity risks
Managing liquidity risk includes ensuring that the com- pany always has sufficient liquid funds or credit lines available to enable it to meet its payment obligations and hedge against risks resulting from fluctuations in payment flows. Among other things, the payment ob- ligations consist of interest and redemption payments.

///Retrieved document 1: In the event of demand falling as a consequence of economic crises, msg life assumes that this would take effect rather more slowly among existing product cus- tomers because, in that segment, loyalty to the solution deployed ensures that any requisite adjustments will also be ordered. With regard to new customers, post- ponements of planned investments can lead to reduc- tions in turnover, especially in product business.
As with all comparable companies, the functional ca- pacity of the business processes is also dependent on the availability and secure operational capacity of the IT infrastructure. External events such as fire, lengthy power or network failures, operational errors or acts of sabotage can, among other things, render the IT infra- structure inoperable. The msg life systems, and also those of its customers, can succumb to viruses which damage and incapacitate the systems or the network. Internal or external attacks can damage, distort or de- lete information and can result in confidential data and information being accessed. The probability and the extent of damage caused by viruses and hackers, by unauthorised persons accessing the IT system and by confidential information being accessed cannot be esti- mated to the fullest extent.
Recovery expenses, loss of production and recourse claims from customers and third parties as a result of system breakdowns or attacks could cause significant damage which, in turn, could influence earnings and endanger the future of the company.
All of the aforementioned economic risks also apply to the current Covid-19 pandemic. In light of the develop- ment of its business with new and existing customers and its project business in the reporting period and in 2022 so far, the company does not foresee any signif- icant impact on its economic or operational develop- ment at the time of writing of these annual financial statements.
The aforementioned economic risks also apply to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February of this year and the resulting economic sanctions against Russia. It is impossible to judge the economic effects of this cri- sis on the course of business of the msg life Group in 2022.

Risks from takeovers
Competition risks
With its solutions, msg life is a leading sector-based service provider for life insurers and pension funds in Europe and in particular for health and group insurers in the United States. This has led to a concentration and therefore an increase in market development risks. At the same time, this increases the company’s profitabil- ity. msg life will therefore attempt to persevere with its existing strategy, including in its current product seg- ments and regional markets, and to cover entire value chains and product ranges with its solutions. In this way, it hopes to achieve a decisive competitive advantage on the market, particularly vis-à-vis new competitors with aggressive pricing policies.
msg life is currently interested in expanding its market position in German-speaking countries and internation- ally, primarily through organic growth. This can also be supported in parallel by strategic acquisitions. The suc- cess of an acquisition is dependent upon whether the acquired company can be successfully integrated in the Group structure and the desired synergy effects can be generated.
Liquidity risks
Managing liquidity risk includes ensuring that the com- pany always has sufficient liquid funds or credit lines available to enable it to meet its payment obligations and hedge against risks resulting from fluctuations in payment flows. Among other things, the payment ob- ligations consist of interest and redemption payments.

///Retrieved document 1: pliance management were incorporated into the early risk detection system. The corresponding risk report for 2021 was presented to the Supervisory Board in Febru- ary 2022.
In 2021, the msg life Group’s profile did not change sig- nificantly with regard to the main types of opportunity and risk areas to which it is exposed. Below, individual types of risk that are identified as being important are explained in greater detail. The specification of these risks does not imply that other risks which have not been mentioned will not have a significant impact on msg life’s earnings, financial and assets position.
Among the Management Board’s most important tasks in the overall management of the Group are, in close coordination with the Supervisory Board, laying down general conditions and processes of risk management for the msg life Group, monitoring the degree of com- pliance with them and, in conjunction with the heads of the operating units and the administrative departments, regularly analysing the development of risks in the re- spective segments.
The msg life Group’s risk management system is docu- mented in a risk manual. One employee in the holding company’s Organisation & IT Services division has been appointed risk manager of the Group and is thereby en- trusted with submitting the prevailing risk management system to regular internal evaluation and documenting this process. It is the responsibility of the managers of the individual divisions to continuously monitor and deal with the risks to which their own divisions are ex- posed.
The foundation of good risk management is the reliable and prompt provision of the management with relevant information about the course of business. For this pur- pose, msg life has set up a monthly controlling and re- porting system.
The early risk detection system of msg life ag proved successful in 2021 as well and it was not necessary to revisit it. The entire procedure is described in the risk management manual and was approved by the Risk Board (risk manager and Management Board). The em- ployees responsible for this field were trained accord- ingly. As part of the ongoing ISO 27001 certification project, the management of information security risks has been expanded further within the overriding central risk management system.

///Retrieved document 2: In terms of the conventional capital accumulation pro- ducts, modifications of the guarantees are dominant, for example through the use of current calculation guidelines or by dispensing with the annual interest guarantee. With the biometric products, too, there is a great deal of action on the market. Dynamic hybrid products have become the standard now and there is a continuous flow of innovative products in addition to them which allow, for example, investment in funds, but also the purchasing of options on the basis of tra- ditional basic cover. Insurance companies at the larger end of the scale in particular are offering products for old-age provision with capital guarantees on the basis of unit-linked approaches with investment guarantees.
Given the current challenges, microservice-oriented ar- chitectures designed to quickly support modified busi- ness models and high system versatility for the rapid in- troduction of innovative products are factors crucial to the success of insurance companies. The developments in insurance products described above are typically not associated with particular product families. The plat- form economy is also playing a key role in the insurance industry this year: numerous insurers are now using platforms and ecosystems to provide digital products and services beyond what had previously been their core business – this in turn is opening up new ways to create value.
For larger insurance companies, the acquisition of closed insurance contract portfolios that are no lon- ger available for sale (‘run-off’ portfolios) from mainly smaller insurance companies remains an important fac- tor. This enables the latter to generate positive effects for their books, and buyers can generate significant economies of scale and cost synergies. Modern asset management with modern and powerful IT systems plays a decisive role in this regard as well in the more efficient management of contracts.

The purpose of liquidity man- agement is to finance predictable deficits at standard market terms under normal market conditions. This means that losses from both borrowing capital at exces- sive interest rates as well as investing surplus funds at interest rates below the market level should be avoided.
Credit risks (default risks):
Credit risk arises from deteriorating economic circum- stances of the company’s debtors or counterparties. Firstly, this results in a risk of partial or complete default on contractually agreed payments and, secondly, in a reduction in the value of financial instruments due to a poorer credit rating.
Credit risk management is responsible for the opera- tional measurement and management of credit risks. Its functions include, in particular, monitoring credit risk positions and exposure and analysis of credit ratings.
Because of the company’s current holdings of cash and cash equivalents, msg life ag considers the liquidity risk to be low at present. The msg life Group has sufficient liquid funds to enable it to service its financial liabili- ties.
As at the balance sheet date, the company had loan agreements with three banks totalling 7.500 million eu- ros. As at the reporting date, the loans had been used in the amount of 1.560 million euros for security deposits.
Risk reporting in respect of the use of financial instruments
Objective and methods of financial risk management:
Financial risk management is designed to put the msg life Group in a position to recognise all the significant risks to which it is potentially exposed at an early stage and to take appropriate countermeasures.

The potential risks to the msg life Group associated with financial instruments consist notably of liquidity risks – which can result in a company being unable to raise the funds needed to settle its financial liabilities – currency risks resulting from its activities in various currency ar- eas, default risks arising from the non-fulfilment of con- tractual obligations by contracting parties and interest rate risks caused by movements in the market interest rate leading to a change in the fair value of a financial instrument and interest-related cash flow risks, which lead to a change in the future cash flows of a financial instrument due to changes in market interest rates.

///Retrieved document 1: For the most part, the operating companies of the Group carry out their business activities in their respective countries. The Group – with the exception of the United States – is therefore not exposed to any significant cur- rency risks in its operating business. A total of 90 per cent of its revenues are generated in eurozone countries (previous year: 87 per cent), and the remainder in Swit- zerland and the United States. The currency risk on the asset side in relation to trade receivables comes from receivables not denominated in euros, accounting for 15 per cent (previous year: 13 per cent). In the case of trade payables, currency risks occur in relation to the 3 per cent of liabilities not denominated in euros (previ- ous year: 5 per cent). Differences arising from currency conversion of financial statements from a foreign cur- rency to the Group currency for the creation of consol- idated financial statements do not affect currency risk because the respective changes in foreign currency are recognised under equity with no effect on income.
Market risks:
Market risks result from changes in market prices. These cause the fair values of financial instruments or future cash flows relating to them to fluctuate. Market risks encompass interest rate, currency and other price risks (such as commodity prices and share prices).
Price risks:
The msg life Group is not exposed to any price risks.
Information on risk concentration (concentration risks):
The company does not have any dependencies on the procurement side. On the sales side, there tend to be concentrations of risk due to the geographic distribu- tion of turnover. For example, Germany accounts for an 88.8 per cent share of turnover (previous year: 85.0 per cent).
Interest rate risks:
Interest rate risks result from a fluctuation in the fair val- ue or future cash flows of a financial instrument due to changes in market interest rates.
Within trade receivables, there is no significant con- centration on individual customers. In the year under review, the ten largest customers accounted for a 64.0 per cent share of turnover (previous year: 61.1 per cent) and a 33.7 per cent share of trade receivables (previous year: 37.9 per cent).

The main potential source of risk in the course of op- erating activity lies in the calculation of the complex projects and in their organisational, functional, techni- cal and commercial handling. These risks are controlled and monitored by means of the valid Group-wide stan- dards for project and project risk management. The risk nevertheless remains that projects cannot be realised profitably for the msg life Group because costs exceed the agreed budget, deadlines cannot be met or the ser- vices rendered fail to comply with the agreed functional specifications or the required quality, and the msg life Group will therefore have to grant a discount or pay com- pensation. The overall risk profile of all ongoing projects was further reduced in 2021. The existing risks of indi- vidual projects have been appropriately taken into ac- count for 2022. The cumulative occurrence in multiple projects could, however, lead to negative effects.
In the 2021 financial year, particular attention was paid to the potential impact of the current Covid-19 pan- demic on the company. The company was quick to take comprehensive action in order to remain operational including, in particular, providing all employees with the necessary hardware and software to work remotely from home and moving almost all work to cyberspace both quickly and consistently. Nevertheless, there is a risk that msg life employees fall ill and are unable to work on customer projects or that customers are unable to perform the necessary supporting services. In turn, it might not be possible to reach agreed project mile- stones on time or at all, resulting in a negative impact on the economic development of the company. Looking at the 2021 financial year, it is once again evident that
The msg life Group also uses software from external suppliers in its own software products. This third-par- ty software can contain defects that might have an adverse effect on the functional capability of the msg life Group’s own products. Problems in the execution of projects and software defects that can occur in the operation of software produced by msg life can do last- ing damage to the reputation of the msg life Group and thereby have a substantial impact on the future course of business.

The Group – with the exception of the United States – is therefore not exposed to any significant cur- rency risks in its operating business. A total of 90 per cent of its revenues are generated in eurozone countries (previous year: 87 per cent), and the remainder in Swit- zerland and the United States. The currency risk on the asset side in relation to trade receivables comes from receivables not denominated in euros, accounting for 15 per cent (previous year: 13 per cent). In the case of trade payables, currency risks occur in relation to the 3 per cent of liabilities not denominated in euros (previ- ous year: 5 per cent). Differences arising from currency conversion of financial statements from a foreign cur- rency to the Group currency for the creation of consol- idated financial statements do not affect currency risk because the respective changes in foreign currency are recognised under equity with no effect on income.
Market risks:
Market risks result from changes in market prices. These cause the fair values of financial instruments or future cash flows relating to them to fluctuate. Market risks encompass interest rate, currency and other price risks (such as commodity prices and share prices).
Price risks:
The msg life Group is not exposed to any price risks.
Information on risk concentration (concentration risks):
The company does not have any dependencies on the procurement side. On the sales side, there tend to be concentrations of risk due to the geographic distribu- tion of turnover. For example, Germany accounts for an 88.8 per cent share of turnover (previous year: 85.0 per cent).
Interest rate risks:
Interest rate risks result from a fluctuation in the fair val- ue or future cash flows of a financial instrument due to changes in market interest rates.
Within trade receivables, there is no significant con- centration on individual customers. In the year under review, the ten largest customers accounted for a 64.0 per cent share of turnover (previous year: 61.1 per cent) and a 33.7 per cent share of trade receivables (previous year: 37.9 per cent).

///Retrieved document 1: The income and operating cash flows of the Group are not, on the whole, exposed to any interest rate risk. There are no significant interest rate risks in relation to its financial assets. The investment of cash and cash equivalents is done on a short-term basis and under- goes the normal market fluctuations. On the condition that all other parameters remained unchanged, the company assumes that interest rates were ten base points lower (higher) in the reporting period. In this case, the net result for 2021 would have been 8,000 euros lower (higher) (previous year: 8,000 euros lower (higher)) and the equity components would have been 8,000 euros lower (higher) (previous year: 8,000 euros lower (higher)).
In the reporting period as well as the previous year, there were no (interest-bearing) financial liabilities with variable interest rates.
Currency risks:
With regard to cash and cash equivalents, there is no concentration on individual institutions.
Overall assessment of the opportunities and risks
msg life believes that, in light of the likelihood of their occurrence and their effects, the risks described above do not represent a threat to the company’s continued existence either individually or as a whole. Senior man- agement remains confident that the Group’s earning power constitutes a solid basis for the future develop- ment of its business and will generate the resources that will be necessary for the Group to pursue the op- portunities that present themselves. In view of its lead- ing position on the market, its functional and techno- logical innovative power, its committed employees and its processes for the early identification of risks, msg life is confident that, in 2022, it will again be able to deal successfully with the challenges that arise from the aforementioned risks.
Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in exchange rates.

///Retrieved document 2: In terms of credit risk, the Group is only exposed to risk in relation to trade receivables. Adequate valuation al- lowances have been made to cover the estimated de- fault risk. As the credit rating of clients in the insurance industry is generally good, the receivables are not in- sured. The maximum default risk is in principle equiva- lent to the nominal values less the valuation allowances. There is no other loan collateral and there are no other risk-mitigating agreements (such as guarantees, land charges or pledges) in place. Usage reservations exist until payment is complete. For invoiced receivables, the net balance of additions to and reversals of valuation allowances was 819,000 euros (previous year: 14,000 euros). On each effective date, trade receivables do not include any carrying amounts for which terms have been renegotiated and which would otherwise be over- due.
With regard to the analysis of trade receivables which are overdue but not impaired as at the end of the report- ing period, the reader is referred to section IV ‘Notes on the statement of financial position’, number 3 ‘Trade receivables’ in the notes.

The potential risks to the msg life Group associated with financial instruments consist notably of liquidity risks – which can result in a company being unable to raise the funds needed to settle its financial liabilities – currency risks resulting from its activities in various currency ar- eas, default risks arising from the non-fulfilment of con- tractual obligations by contracting parties and interest rate risks caused by movements in the market interest rate leading to a change in the fair value of a financial instrument and interest-related cash flow risks, which lead to a change in the future cash flows of a financial instrument due to changes in market interest rates.
Organisation:
The company has organised its risk management pro- cess along clear, functional lines. Specific tasks have been assigned to the individual organisational units involved in the risk management process. More infor- mation is available under ‘General’ in this section.
There are no default risks in relation to cash and cash equivalents. These are invested at banks with good rat- ings.

In connection with its ongoing internationalisation strategy, msg life and IBM have entered into a partner- ship to open up new insurance markets. The goal is to significantly increase the competitiveness of interna- tional insurance companies through a fully digitised end-to-end solution, thereby securing their future.
In the past, the strategic presence of msg life in each foreign market was an important success factor when it came to attracting new customers.

Overall, msg life continues to enjoy steady growth in the various insurance sectors in the US market and intends to exploit the potential for business that this represents.

Moreover, an acquisition was com- pleted successfully for Mutual Medica in Spain and the project began shortly after the end of the reporting peri- od. msg life continues to expect sales successes in that market in the current year.
msg life is serving the Central and Eastern European markets as well as other niche markets and segments from Slovenia in particular; as German-language in- surers are particularly striving to access these highly competitive markets, they regularly offer interesting sales opportunities for msg life. The company has a presence in many Eastern European countries with the Unified Administration Platform (UAP). As a result of the growing consulting business that is developing in connection with its local presences, msg life expects these markets to generate cross-selling effects. In the reporting period, SwissCaution awarded a contract to roll out the UAP. msg life received another contract for this system from Calingo Insurance AG in Switzerland, as well as from Zurich Cantonal Bank shortly after the end of the reporting period.
As previously reported, there were numerous new or- ders for msg life in 2021 and the company expects rele- vant new business in the 2022 financial year. Business with existing customers in connection with the software components was also strong. Additionally, nearly all of the major projects set out in the corporate plan were executed in the reporting period. As in previous years, msg life focused on sales projects in well-established markets in particular in the 2021 financial year.
During the reporting period, msg life continued to work on the introduction of an information security man- agement system (ISMS). Significant aspects of the es- tablishment of the ISMS are the definition and imple- mentation of more security guidelines in the software development process and other technical, HR and IT processes – with the objective of subsequent certifi- cation pursuant to the internationally recognised stan- dard ISO:IEC 27001. The internationally recognised in- stitute TÜV Rheinland is accompanying the process as certifying body.

involving an enormous number of resources. In 2021, the European Commission presented its proposed revi- sion of the regulatory regime Solvency II which has been in force since 2016. The legislative procedure current- ly involves the European Parliament and the European Council. According to the GDV, the amendments should remain balanced because Solvency II has proven itself so far.
cation ‘Insurance IT: A key to greater sustainability’ pub- lished in January 2022, software standardisation, the replacement of legacy systems and cloud computing are among the most important IT projects. According to Branchenkompass Insurance 2021, the replacement of legacy systems with cloud computing IT is considered a recurring theme in the industry. It reports that more than 60 per cent of insurers are currently working to mi- grate to cloud-based solutions.
In March 2021, the European Commission introduced the Transparency Directive (Sustainable Finance Dis- closure Regulation; SFDR) for financial service provid- ers. The directive governs the disclosure obligations of pro duct providers and financial advisors in terms of sustainability in strategies, processes and products. The regulatory requirements also apply to insurance brokers, life insurers and providers of company pension schemes. The Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) that expand on the directive are expected to apply from mid- 2022 onwards. This will increase the amount of regula- tory paperwork for life insurers and providers of compa- ny pension schemes.
In Europe, the insurance industry largely managed to remain on track in 2020, the first year of the pandemic, according to the European Insurance Study 2021 pub- lished by Zeb Consulting in December 2021. Although insurers did have to accept larger drops in profits and premiums in some cases, the industry was in good over- all condition when it was hit by the crisis, enabling it to mostly remain profitable. Even the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) describes the European insurance industry as ‘fundamentally ro- bust’. This is demonstrated by the results of the stress test 2021 that were published in December 2021. The test included 43 major European insurance groups, in- cluding five from Germany.

///Retrieved document 2: Strategic opportunities
msg life regards the continuation of regulation through- out the insurance sector as a direct consequence of the financial crisis. Like the ongoing low-interest phase, this regulation is necessitating a great deal of adapta- tion with regard to the solutions currently used in the insurance sector and is reinforcing the trend towards the use of standard software and cross-sector platform solutions – such as those offered by msg life. At this time, the situation in the insurance market is proving to be an opportunity for the company, as demonstrated by the new contracts over the past few years and current sales projects.
In the past, the Group company FJA-US, Inc. profited from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) which was enacted in 2013 in terms of both turnover and earnings. After the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act suffered from a lack of support from the Trump administration, the Biden administra- tion pressed on with an improvement to the Patient Pro- tection and Affordable Care Act in late 2021 in the form of the Build Back Better Act. As a result, state healthcare programmes such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid can be expected to grow further. Thanks to its now well-established partnerships with leading providers such as Companion Data Services, the msg life Group company in the USA can offer end-to-end ser- vices including claims handling. Additionally, the com- pany successfully expanded its related activities in the health and group insurance market and further diversi- fied its range of services.

Additionally, turnover from the US business decreased by 6.1 million euros.","///Retrieved document 0: Compared to the previous year, turnover decreased by 6.5 million euros from 56.5 million euros to 50.0 million euros. This development was driven by turnover from third parties which decreased by 9.4 million euros, and internal turnover (i.e. turnover from companies within the msg life Group) which increased by 2.9 million eu- ros. Other operating income came to 0.4 million euros (previous year: 0.6 million euros).
The net total of the line item ‘Inventories’ has increased from 4.3 million euros to 7.5 million euros as payments received on account and work in progress exceeded the payments received on account of customer projects as at the reporting date. Due to the chosen method of open recognition, the net amount of 7.5 million euros has been recognised under inventories.
Non-current assets decreased on the whole by 1.5 mil- lion euros, from 6.6 million euros in the previous year to 5.1 million euros. In the 2021 financial year, proper- ty, plant and equipment decreased by 1.1 million euros. Overall, intangible assets decreased by 0.4 million eu- ros to 1.0 million euros. Before they were netted against deferred tax liabilities, the deferred tax assets totalled 0.3 million euros (previous year: 0.4 million euros).
Expenses for the procurement of services were 11.6 mil- lion euros lower than in the previous year and amount- ed to 28.4 million euros in the financial year ended (pre- vious year: 40.0 million euros).
Both in the 2021 financial year and in the same period in the previous year, the development of msg life ag’s turnover and expenses resulting from the procurement of services was mainly due to the interim delivery of a milestone within the framework of a major project with msg systems ag.
At 8.4 million euros (previous year: 8.9 million euros), personnel expenses were just 0.5 million euros lower than the previous year.
Provisions decreased by a total of 1.8 million euros to 25.8 million euros. Essentially, this change was due to the decrease in other provisions by 2.7 million euros to 17.7 million euros.

In terms of product-based turnover, licensing income came to 14.1 million euros in the reporting period (previous year: 18.7 million euros), which represents 7.3 per cent of total turnover (previous year: 10.0 per cent). Maintenance turnover came to 23.6 million euros in 2021 (previous year: 21.0 million euros) and therefore makes up 12.2 per cent of the total turn- over (previous year: 11.2 per cent).
The other turnover largely comprised computing centre services in 2021. This figure remained nearly constant in the past financial year at 5.9 million euros (previous year: 6.1 million euros).
As for the regional breakdown of turnover, the aggre- gate figure for Germany in the 2021 financial year to- talled 172.2 million euros (previous year: 159.3 million euros) and 21.6 million euros in other countries (previ- ous year: 28.2 million euros). Consequently, the level of demand for msg life solutions in the German-speaking market remains high.
The msg life Group reported a decrease in turnover in its US business, where turnover fell from 23.7 million euros to 17.6 million euros. Slovenia is the second-strongest foreign market in terms of turnover, with turnover in the 2021 financial year amounting to 1.7 million euros (previous year: 2.1 million euros). In Portugal and Spain, the company experienced a slight increase in turnover of 0.2 million euros to 0.8 million euros.

Additionally, the industry is also focusing on customer centricity, individualisation, industrialisation, automation, analytics, data effectiveness, and the use of artificial intelligence, robo-advisers, advanced analytics, and blockchain.","///Retrieved document 0: The digitisation of our economy and society has been accelerated greatly by the Covid-19 pandemic and re- mains one of the most significant challenges facing the German insurance industry. Digitised business pro- cesses enable the ever-greater integration of systems across divisions, segments and company boundaries. That makes it possible to exploit the potential repre- sented by the standardisation and automation of pro- cesses to a greater extent. Fully automated processes lead to enormous gains with regard to efficiency as well as significantly lower costs. The subjects of customer centricity and individualisation, industrialisation and automation, analytics and data effectiveness, and stan- dardisation and integration are at the heart of the digi- tisation trend. Insurers are increasingly committed to cloud solutions with which IT capacities can be adapted to meet the level of demand in a flexible manner.
With digitisation, modern insurance products and ser- vices can be made available on new channels or inte- grated into new sales and cooperation platforms; all of this requires extensive changes to the IT landscapes of insurers in order for the new technology and platforms to be integrated and is taken into account by msg life when it develops its products and services. The compa- ny already has SaaS and cloud-based solutions to sup- port its customers with the digitisation process, thanks in no small part to its strategic collaboration with IBM.
In light of these developments, msg life anticipates that insurance companies will show a general interest in the software and consulting solutions it will be offering in 2022.
Artificial intelligence (AI) is also becoming increasingly relevant as a topic. The use of AI (and automated ma- chine learning at its heart) not only improves efficiency through automation, but also facilitates new technical approaches which in turn pave the way for entirely new business models, services and products. In connection with AI, insurers are also concentrating on robo-advis- ers, advanced analytics and blockchain.
For one, msg life is responding to this with the TRAIL.X project, where deep neural networks (DNNs) are being developed for the actuarial computation module in cooperation with the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. These DNNs will enable life insurers to replace old system generations, map their core functions with artificial intelligence and integrate them into a modern system.

///Retrieved document 1: With regard to old-age pensions, the German govern- ment has also decided to introduce a digital pension overview. It aims to provide customers with a quick over- view of their statutory, company and private pension en- titlements. The German Pension Overview Act (RentÜG) came into effect on 18 February 2021. The law requires all providers of private and company old-age pensions to connect to the portal if they are obliged to send regu- lar summaries to their customers while they are paying into the pension. After a 21-month development phase, the platform is set to go live in autumn 2023.
Likewise, insurers in the USA have survived the crisis rel- atively well. This is the conclusion of the article entitled ‘Der Versicherungsmarkt USA im Blick’ (‘A look at the US insurance market’) published by the R&D service pro- vider Versicherungsforen Leipzig in December 2021. It states that gross premiums grew by 0.6 per cent overall in 2020. Although growth of 1.2 per cent was achieved in the non-life segment, life premiums decreased by 1.4 per cent. With gross premiums of 2.5 billion dollars, the US insurance industry is a global market leader: the USA accounts for more than 40 per cent of the global market.
Finally, the launch of a voluntary Pan-European Pen- sion Product (PEPP) has been decided on a European level. The regulatory technical standards were defined in March 2021. PEPP is to be available throughout Eu- rope, although providers will have to meet strict criteria before they are permitted to offer it. The European pen- sion is designed to be complementary to existing state, statutory and occupational pension systems. Potential providers of the pension include insurance companies, company pension funds, banks and administrators of alternative investment funds.
Digitisation also remains at the top of the agenda for the German insurance industry. In particular, digitisa- tion has been accelerated greatly by the Covid-19 crisis. Digitised business processes enable the ever-greater integration of systems across divisions, segments and company boundaries. That makes it possible to exploit the potential represented by the standardisation and automation of processes to a greater extent. Fully auto- mated processes lead to enormous gains with regard to efficiency as well as significantly lower costs.

///Retrieved document 2: Following an excellent 2021 financial year, msg life is registering a high level of demand for solutions in the first quarter of the current 2022 financial year – from insurance companies in Germany and other countries in equal measure. In this context, msg life also expects to see further regulation throughout the financial ser- vices sector. Be it the revision of Solvency II, the new international accounting standard IFRS 17, the Europe- an Transparency Directive, the rollout of a digital pen- sion overview or the introduction of PEPP, the ongoing implementation of numerous regulatory requirements necessitates comprehensive changes to the solutions which are currently used and ties up vast amounts of insurers’ resources. This means that the use of versatile, cost-effective standard software remains highly attrac- tive throughout the insurance industry.
Consequently, the German-speaking market will remain very challenging for all insurance companies this year and probably in the years to come. The ongoing trend towards internationalisation and consolidation is an- other factor and, given the efforts to reduce costs and increase efficiency within insurance companies, there is a clear correlation between modern and flexible IT on the one hand and corporate success on the other.

Despite persistently difficult general conditions, private life insurance cover remains indispensable in Germany in view of the demographic trend and the necessity of covering against biometric risks. In the process, almost all insurers are striving to enhance their existing pro- duct ranges and develop new, innovative ones – this goes for all existing product groups, control layers and legal forms. The companies’ starting situations and the pressure on them to innovate vary and are consequent- ly bringing about a variety of innovations. The focus is on products that tick more than one box at the same time: products that satisfy the desire of the policyhold- ers for security, returns and flexibility, meet the needs of the insurer in terms of more efficiency and profitabil- ity and comply with the regulatory requirements at the same time.

EARNINGS POSITION
In the reporting year, current assets increased from 74.5 million euros in the previous year to 92.3 million euros. Essentially, this development was due to the fact that securities were 12.4 million euros higher and accounts receivable were 6.9 million euros higher as at the re- porting date. On the other hand, liquid funds decreased by 5.0 million euros from 22.9 million euros to 17.9 mil- lion euros, which had the opposite effect.

Financial management is designed to enable the msg life Group to have the necessary funds at its disposal at all times so that it is capable of taking action in its operating activities to deal with volatility of incoming orders, fluctuations in customers’ payment behaviour and investment needs. In the process, all the significant risks to which the msg life Group is potentially exposed must be recognised at an early stage and the necessary scope for suitable protective measures provided for. Within the framework of liquidity management, care is taken that sufficient funds and appropriate liquidity re- serves are freely available at all times. In the financial year ended, the msg life Group was able to meet all pay- ment obligations in their entirety.
FINANCING ANALYSIS
The income and operating cash flows of the Group are not, on the whole, exposed to any interest rate risk. In general, liquid funds are invested for short periods. Fi- nancial liabilities are short to medium term in nature.
With regard to the credit risk (default risk), there are no significant concentrations on individual customers in the Group. Receivables are not insured, primarily due to the high credit rating of the customers in the insurance sector.

The company ex- pects these developments to continue in 2022.
msg life was able to achieve sales successes in almost every region in which the company operated in 2021:
In the German-speaking market, the contracts for a proof of concept relating to the potential rollout of msg. Insurance Suite were signed with a well-known life in- surer and, shortly after the end of the reporting period, a start-up life insurer. Furthermore, the long-standing customer HUK-Coburg awarded contracts to roll out msg.RAN and msg.Tax Data. Likewise, the company was awarded contracts to roll out msg.Tax Data from Öffent- liche Versicherung Braunschweig and AXA Lebensver- sicherung AG. ERGO also placed an order to introduce msg.Life Product, the mathematical component of msg. Life Factory.
msg life is also cultivating the Benelux market inten- sively from the German-speaking countries. After gain- ing AEGON in the Netherlands as a customer in 2020, msg life is generating interest there with its range of products, especially from insurance groups which op- erate nationally.
The business of msg life in the United States for primar- ily health and group insurers was satisfactory up to the end of the reporting period. FJA-US, Inc. – the msg life Group company located in the United States – record- ed continuous successful development with solutions such as the Unified Distribution Platform, the Unified Product Platform and the web-based multi-channel platform msg.Sales. In the 2021 financial year, the com- pany attracted two new, well-known customers from the health and life insurance segments and recorded over- all growth in customer demand for services.

The range of services offered by msg life in the United States encompasses not only software products and technical consulting services on all aspects of product and tariff structuring, but also operator models – with the latter generating growing interest in the market. In 2021, the company’s gained its first customers for such an operator model (i.e. SaaS) in which the customer pays a fee to use and operate the software.

Summarised evaluation of the company’s business situation
The 2021 financial year was another strong year for the msg life Group. Numerous sales successes with the cor- responding licence income, the very stable business with existing customers and continually low travel costs due to the still-ongoing coronavirus pandemic resulted in the targets set at the beginning of the financial year with regard to the financial key performance indicators of Group revenue from its own business (HGB) and Group earnings (HGB) being exceeded.
In the reporting period, the msg life Group recorded gross Group revenue from its own business under Ger- man GAAP of 176.1 million euros and Group earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) under German GAAP of 17.9 million euros.
The business situation of the company in the 2021 re- porting year can be described as positive overall. The foundations exist for positive development in 2022 and beyond. Last year’s prognosis in the separate financial statements forecast positive net results for the year; as the holding company, the individual Group company finished the 2021 financial year with net profit of 10.8 million euros.
Non-financial performance indicators
The msg life Group’s efficiency is reflected not only in its commercial indicators, but also in its non-financial per- formance indicators. The most important of these in the msg life Group are the issues that concern its employ- ees. The relevant disclosures can be found in the ‘Em- ployees’ chapter within this condensed management report and Group management report.

The purpose of the financing activity consists primarily of making interest-bearing loans to Group companies, making cash investments and dis- tributing earnings from participating interests.
The primary income potential for the holding company lies in earnings from participating interests. For this rea- son, the disclosures of the Group concerning the devel- opment of markets, the general economic environment and opportunities and risks also apply to the holding company.
As a holding company, the individual Group company is responsible for financing the Group companies as well as for their strategic and, to a limited extent, oper- ational management.

Opportunity and risk report
General
All the following estimations regarding opportunities and risks were made on the reporting date, 31 Decem- ber 2021.
In the type of business it conducts, the msg life Group is exposed to a large number of uncertainties which, if realised, can affect the Group’s earnings, financial and assets position, and that of the company, either posi- tively or negatively, or result in msg life falling short of or exceeding the targets it has set itself for the future development of its business.

///Retrieved document 2: Under the management mechanisms now in place, the daily holdings of cash and cash equivalents and the monthly rolling financial plans are monitored by the company’s management. The purpose of liquidity man- agement is to finance predictable deficits at standard market terms under normal market conditions. This means that losses from both borrowing capital at exces- sive interest rates as well as investing surplus funds at interest rates below the market level should be avoided.
Credit risks (default risks):
Credit risk arises from deteriorating economic circum- stances of the company’s debtors or counterparties. Firstly, this results in a risk of partial or complete default on contractually agreed payments and, secondly, in a reduction in the value of financial instruments due to a poorer credit rating.
Credit risk management is responsible for the opera- tional measurement and management of credit risks. Its functions include, in particular, monitoring credit risk positions and exposure and analysis of credit ratings.
Because of the company’s current holdings of cash and cash equivalents, msg life ag considers the liquidity risk to be low at present. The msg life Group has sufficient liquid funds to enable it to service its financial liabili- ties.
As at the balance sheet date, the company had loan agreements with three banks totalling 7.500 million eu- ros. As at the reporting date, the loans had been used in the amount of 1.560 million euros for security deposits.
Risk reporting in respect of the use of financial instruments
Objective and methods of financial risk management:
Financial risk management is designed to put the msg life Group in a position to recognise all the significant risks to which it is potentially exposed at an early stage and to take appropriate countermeasures.

///Retrieved document 2: With more than 1,200 employees at sites in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Slovakia, Slove- nia, Portugal, Spain and the United States, msg life is very well positioned in the field of software and consult- ing services for insurance companies and pension fund institutions. msg life’s wide range of digitised products and services for life insurance companies in Europe and, in particular, health and group insurance companies in the United States, gives it excellent market opportuni- ties and a promising competitive position.
In connection with its ongoing internationalisation strategy, msg life and IBM have entered into a partner- ship to open up new insurance markets. The goal is to significantly increase the competitiveness of interna- tional insurance companies through a fully digitised end-to-end solution, thereby securing their future.
In the past, the strategic presence of msg life in each foreign market was an important success factor when it came to attracting new customers. It is also becoming more and more apparent that Group companies want to put the solutions implemented for one region at the disposal of other Group companies in other countries – which can advance the ongoing internationalisation of msg life as a service provider for its customers. Besides the established partnership with IBM, the objective in the 2022 financial year is to press ahead with ma- jor sales projects, especially in the established foreign markets, as in the 2021 financial year.
With regard to the US market, msg life is currently exam- ining whether it would be possible to deploy a localised version of its portfolio of European life insurance prod- ucts in connection with its specific US products as an integrated solution. Overall, msg life continues to enjoy steady growth in the various insurance sectors in the US market and intends to exploit the potential for business that this represents. In addition to the implementation and integration of specific software products, the range of services offered by msg life encompasses a variety of consulting services in connection with product and tar- iff modelling, for example, as well as operator models – these are generating growing interest in the market.

The shareholders’ meeting is of the opinion that personal qualifications and ability, not gender, should be the decisive factor with regard to filling po- sitions on the Supervisory Board and among the man- aging directors. As such, no considerations that are not solely based on the candidate’s personal and profes- sional suitability for a role should be decisive.

///Retrieved document 1: In terms of the conventional capital accumulation pro- ducts, modifications of the guarantees are dominant, for example through the use of current calculation guidelines or by dispensing with the annual interest guarantee. With the biometric products, too, there is a great deal of action on the market. Dynamic hybrid products have become the standard now and there is a continuous flow of innovative products in addition to them which allow, for example, investment in funds, but also the purchasing of options on the basis of tra- ditional basic cover. Insurance companies at the larger end of the scale in particular are offering products for old-age provision with capital guarantees on the basis of unit-linked approaches with investment guarantees.
Given the current challenges, microservice-oriented ar- chitectures designed to quickly support modified busi- ness models and high system versatility for the rapid in- troduction of innovative products are factors crucial to the success of insurance companies. The developments in insurance products described above are typically not associated with particular product families. The plat- form economy is also playing a key role in the insurance industry this year: numerous insurers are now using platforms and ecosystems to provide digital products and services beyond what had previously been their core business – this in turn is opening up new ways to create value.
For larger insurance companies, the acquisition of closed insurance contract portfolios that are no lon- ger available for sale (‘run-off’ portfolios) from mainly smaller insurance companies remains an important fac- tor. This enables the latter to generate positive effects for their books, and buyers can generate significant economies of scale and cost synergies. Modern asset management with modern and powerful IT systems plays a decisive role in this regard as well in the more efficient management of contracts.

Summarised evaluation of the company’s business situation
The 2021 financial year was another strong year for the msg life Group. Numerous sales successes with the cor- responding licence income, the very stable business with existing customers and continually low travel costs due to the still-ongoing coronavirus pandemic resulted in the targets set at the beginning of the financial year with regard to the financial key performance indicators of Group revenue from its own business (HGB) and Group earnings (HGB) being exceeded.
In the reporting period, the msg life Group recorded gross Group revenue from its own business under Ger- man GAAP of 176.1 million euros and Group earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) under German GAAP of 17.9 million euros.
The business situation of the company in the 2021 re- porting year can be described as positive overall. The foundations exist for positive development in 2022 and beyond. Last year’s prognosis in the separate financial statements forecast positive net results for the year; as the holding company, the individual Group company finished the 2021 financial year with net profit of 10.8 million euros.
Non-financial performance indicators
The msg life Group’s efficiency is reflected not only in its commercial indicators, but also in its non-financial per- formance indicators. The most important of these in the msg life Group are the issues that concern its employ- ees. The relevant disclosures can be found in the ‘Em- ployees’ chapter within this condensed management report and Group management report.

Macroeconomic and sector-specific conditions
At the time of writing of the condensed management report and Group management report, the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 on the general economic and sector-specific conditions in the current 2022 financial year and beyond was not yet evident and has therefore not been taken into account in the follow- ing disclosures regarding both subject areas.
With regard to Europe, the experts at the IMF expect the economy to grow by 5.0 per cent in 2021 and by 4.3 per cent this year. The forecasts of the OECD (Organisa- tion for Economic Co-operation and Development) are somewhat more optimistic: The experts expect growth of 5.2 per cent in the previous year and 4.3 per cent in 2022. According to the experts, new variants of Covid-19 and insufficient rates of vaccination are just two factors that represent risks. Additionally, economic stimulus packages are running out and corrections are looming on the property markets.
The Covid-19 pandemic continues to overshadow in- ternational economic activity. According to the Global Economic Prospect Report published by the World Bank in January 2022, the global economy is in a distinct de- cline compounded by new variants of Covid-19 as well as high inflation, debt and income inequality, following a strong upturn in 2021. Economists expect the global growth rate to fall from 5.5 per cent in 2021 to 4.1 per cent this year. The World Bank expects it to increase by 3.2 per cent in 2023.

///Retrieved document 1: According to the calculations of the Federal Statistical Office, Germany’s GDP grew by 2.8 per cent in 2021 after having fallen by 4.6 per cent in the same period in the previous year. ‘After economic performance had increased again last summer despite growing delivery bottlenecks and material shortages, the recovery of the German economy came to a halt at the end of the year due to the fourth Covid-19 wave and another reinforce- ment of Covid-19 preventive measures’, reported the Federal Statistical Office in January 2022. Compared to the crisis in 2020, economic performance improved in almost every area in 2021. However, it has not yet reached its pre-crisis level.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently down- graded the forecast it released last October in its up- dated World Economic Outlook in January 2022. The IMF expects the global economy to grow by just 4.4 per cent this year, following growth of 5.9 per cent last year – 0.5 per cent less than initially forecast. The IMF attributes this to the current Covid-19 situation, supply bottle- necks and the high rate of inflation. Like the World Bank, the IMF predicts growth of 3.2 per cent in 2023.
The IMF has downgraded its forecast by 1.2 percentage points to 4 per cent for the USA this year, the world’s largest economy. The IMF has even downgraded its fore- cast by 0.8 percentage points to 4.8 per cent for China, the world’s second-largest economy.
According to the IMF, the dramatic rise in inflation will remain high in 2022 due to ongoing supply difficulties and high energy prices. The organisation expects in- dustrialised nations to see an average inflation rate of 3.9 per cent. The average rate of inflation in developing countries and emerging economies is expected to be 5.9 per cent.

///Retrieved document 2: Under the more difficult conditions of the Covid-19 pan- demic, the German insurance industry closed the 2021 financial year with a ‘solid’ performance, concludes Wolfgang Weiler, president of the Gesamtverband der Deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft (GDV), at its annual media conference in January 2022. He announced that insurers reported an increase in premiums of 1.1 per cent (previous year: 1.6 per cent) across all segments, reaching 223.4 billion euros.
The outlook for 2022 is cautiously optimistic. Accord- ing to the GDV, the industry expects premium growth of between 2 and 3 per cent. With regard to life insur- ance, the Covid-19 pandemic can be expected to have an impact on business prospects in the current year too. Premium growth of between 1 and 2 per cent could be considered realistic here. The GDV expects a weaker performance from traditional life insurance products, although market-oriented products are expected to grow more strongly. ‘The decisive factors here are the economic prospects of private households and the gen- eral political conditions for private old-age pensions in the current legislative period’, said Weiler.
The GDV goes on to report that the premium income of life insurers and pension funds amounted to around 102 billion euros in the financial year ended. That amount is 1.4 per cent lower than in 2020. Whereas current pre- mium income increased slightly to 65.3 billion euros, one-time premiums declined to 36.5 billion euros (-4.7 per cent).
According to the GDV, new Riester business performed well with growth of 12 per cent to 310,500 contracts. The portfolio largely remained stable, with around 10.4 mil- lion contracts. With regard to basic pensions, the num- ber of newly brokered policies increased by almost 40 per cent to 119,000 contracts. This caused the overall portfolio to grow by 4 per cent to 2.5 million contracts.

The persistently low interest rates were a concern of the insurance industry in the 2021 financial year as well. The ECB launched a multi-billion-euro emergen- cy purchase programme in March 2020 to mitigate the severe economic impacts of the Covid-19 crisis: under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), the ECB will purchase up to 1.85 billion euros’ worth of government and corporate bonds until March 2022 at the earliest.
In September 2021, the ECB decided to reduce the rate of PEPP purchases moderately. The ECB announced its decision at the most recent ECB meeting on 3 February 2022. At the same time, the ECB left the key interest rate in the Eurozone at 0 per cent, while the deposit facili- ty rate also remained unchanged at -0.5 per cent. This means that banks must continue to pay penalty rates if they deposit surplus money with the ECB.
In light of the rapid rise in inflation, ECB President Christine Lagarde refused to rule out an interest rate increase this year. As such, the ECB is prepared to ad- just all available instruments in order to reach its 2 per cent inflation target in the medium term. Lagarde made an announcement to this effect at the press conference afterwards.

///Retrieved document 1: Following an excellent 2021 financial year, msg life is registering a high level of demand for solutions in the first quarter of the current 2022 financial year – from insurance companies in Germany and other countries in equal measure. In this context, msg life also expects to see further regulation throughout the financial ser- vices sector. Be it the revision of Solvency II, the new international accounting standard IFRS 17, the Europe- an Transparency Directive, the rollout of a digital pen- sion overview or the introduction of PEPP, the ongoing implementation of numerous regulatory requirements necessitates comprehensive changes to the solutions which are currently used and ties up vast amounts of insurers’ resources. This means that the use of versatile, cost-effective standard software remains highly attrac- tive throughout the insurance industry.
Consequently, the German-speaking market will remain very challenging for all insurance companies this year and probably in the years to come. The ongoing trend towards internationalisation and consolidation is an- other factor and, given the efforts to reduce costs and increase efficiency within insurance companies, there is a clear correlation between modern and flexible IT on the one hand and corporate success on the other.

Despite persistently difficult general conditions, private life insurance cover remains indispensable in Germany in view of the demographic trend and the necessity of covering against biometric risks. In the process, almost all insurers are striving to enhance their existing pro- duct ranges and develop new, innovative ones – this goes for all existing product groups, control layers and legal forms. The companies’ starting situations and the pressure on them to innovate vary and are consequent- ly bringing about a variety of innovations. The focus is on products that tick more than one box at the same time: products that satisfy the desire of the policyhold- ers for security, returns and flexibility, meet the needs of the insurer in terms of more efficiency and profitabil- ity and comply with the regulatory requirements at the same time.

In November last year, the DAV also recommended that this level remain in place until 2023: ‘We do not current- ly see signs of a noticeable recovery in interest rates in the near future, not least in light of the economic uncer- tainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic’, said Herbert Schneidemann, chairman of the DAV, to support the recommendation.
For this reason, more and more insurers are developing new products with different guarantee models, moving away from traditional policies with guaranteed interest in the process. In the financial year ended, some insur- ers even abandoned the 100 per cent premium guar- antee completely. They only offer a complete premium guarantee where they are required by law to do so.
Regulatory matters were also high on the list of insurers’ priorities in the financial year ended. Be it the Europe- an Transparency Directive, the revision of Solvency II or the introduction of new international financial reporting rules (IFRS 17), the implementation of statutory regula- tions has made it necessary to make extensive adjust- ments.

This caused the overall portfolio to grow by 4 per cent to 2.5 million contracts.

involving an enormous number of resources. In 2021, the European Commission presented its proposed revi- sion of the regulatory regime Solvency II which has been in force since 2016. The legislative procedure current- ly involves the European Parliament and the European Council. According to the GDV, the amendments should remain balanced because Solvency II has proven itself so far.
cation ‘Insurance IT: A key to greater sustainability’ pub- lished in January 2022, software standardisation, the replacement of legacy systems and cloud computing are among the most important IT projects. According to Branchenkompass Insurance 2021, the replacement of legacy systems with cloud computing IT is considered a recurring theme in the industry. It reports that more than 60 per cent of insurers are currently working to mi- grate to cloud-based solutions.
In March 2021, the European Commission introduced the Transparency Directive (Sustainable Finance Dis- closure Regulation; SFDR) for financial service provid- ers. The directive governs the disclosure obligations of pro duct providers and financial advisors in terms of sustainability in strategies, processes and products. The regulatory requirements also apply to insurance brokers, life insurers and providers of company pension schemes. The Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) that expand on the directive are expected to apply from mid- 2022 onwards. This will increase the amount of regula- tory paperwork for life insurers and providers of compa- ny pension schemes.
In Europe, the insurance industry largely managed to remain on track in 2020, the first year of the pandemic, according to the European Insurance Study 2021 pub- lished by Zeb Consulting in December 2021. Although insurers did have to accept larger drops in profits and premiums in some cases, the industry was in good over- all condition when it was hit by the crisis, enabling it to mostly remain profitable. Even the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) describes the European insurance industry as ‘fundamentally ro- bust’. This is demonstrated by the results of the stress test 2021 that were published in December 2021. The test included 43 major European insurance groups, in- cluding five from Germany.

Opportunity and risk report
General
All the following estimations regarding opportunities and risks were made on the reporting date, 31 Decem- ber 2021.
In the type of business it conducts, the msg life Group is exposed to a large number of uncertainties which, if realised, can affect the Group’s earnings, financial and assets position, and that of the company, either posi- tively or negatively, or result in msg life falling short of or exceeding the targets it has set itself for the future development of its business.

///Retrieved document 2: With regard to old-age pensions, the German govern- ment has also decided to introduce a digital pension overview. It aims to provide customers with a quick over- view of their statutory, company and private pension en- titlements. The German Pension Overview Act (RentÜG) came into effect on 18 February 2021. The law requires all providers of private and company old-age pensions to connect to the portal if they are obliged to send regu- lar summaries to their customers while they are paying into the pension. After a 21-month development phase, the platform is set to go live in autumn 2023.
Likewise, insurers in the USA have survived the crisis rel- atively well. This is the conclusion of the article entitled ‘Der Versicherungsmarkt USA im Blick’ (‘A look at the US insurance market’) published by the R&D service pro- vider Versicherungsforen Leipzig in December 2021. It states that gross premiums grew by 0.6 per cent overall in 2020. Although growth of 1.2 per cent was achieved in the non-life segment, life premiums decreased by 1.4 per cent. With gross premiums of 2.5 billion dollars, the US insurance industry is a global market leader: the USA accounts for more than 40 per cent of the global market.
Finally, the launch of a voluntary Pan-European Pen- sion Product (PEPP) has been decided on a European level. The regulatory technical standards were defined in March 2021. PEPP is to be available throughout Eu- rope, although providers will have to meet strict criteria before they are permitted to offer it. The European pen- sion is designed to be complementary to existing state, statutory and occupational pension systems. Potential providers of the pension include insurance companies, company pension funds, banks and administrators of alternative investment funds.
Digitisation also remains at the top of the agenda for the German insurance industry. In particular, digitisa- tion has been accelerated greatly by the Covid-19 crisis. Digitised business processes enable the ever-greater integration of systems across divisions, segments and company boundaries. That makes it possible to exploit the potential represented by the standardisation and automation of processes to a greater extent. Fully auto- mated processes lead to enormous gains with regard to efficiency as well as significantly lower costs.

///Retrieved document 1: In light of interest rates having remained low for years, the Federal Ministry of Finance decided in March 2021 to lower the projected interest rate for new life insur- ance contracts from 0.9 per cent to 0.25 per cent from 1 January 2022 onwards. The German actuarial associ- ation Deutsche Aktuarvereinigung (DAV) had called for this to happen numerous times, as extensive premium guarantees were no longer reasonable from an actuari- al standpoint due to the persistently low interest rates. In November last year, the DAV also recommended that this level remain in place until 2023: ‘We do not current- ly see signs of a noticeable recovery in interest rates in the near future, not least in light of the economic uncer- tainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic’, said Herbert Schneidemann, chairman of the DAV, to support the recommendation.
For this reason, more and more insurers are developing new products with different guarantee models, moving away from traditional policies with guaranteed interest in the process. In the financial year ended, some insur- ers even abandoned the 100 per cent premium guar- antee completely. They only offer a complete premium guarantee where they are required by law to do so.
Regulatory matters were also high on the list of insurers’ priorities in the financial year ended. Be it the Europe- an Transparency Directive, the revision of Solvency II or the introduction of new international financial reporting rules (IFRS 17), the implementation of statutory regula- tions has made it necessary to make extensive adjust- ments. For many companies, this is a tremendous effort

///Retrieved document 2: Under the more difficult conditions of the Covid-19 pan- demic, the German insurance industry closed the 2021 financial year with a ‘solid’ performance, concludes Wolfgang Weiler, president of the Gesamtverband der Deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft (GDV), at its annual media conference in January 2022. He announced that insurers reported an increase in premiums of 1.1 per cent (previous year: 1.6 per cent) across all segments, reaching 223.4 billion euros.
The outlook for 2022 is cautiously optimistic. Accord- ing to the GDV, the industry expects premium growth of between 2 and 3 per cent. With regard to life insur- ance, the Covid-19 pandemic can be expected to have an impact on business prospects in the current year too. Premium growth of between 1 and 2 per cent could be considered realistic here. The GDV expects a weaker performance from traditional life insurance products, although market-oriented products are expected to grow more strongly. ‘The decisive factors here are the economic prospects of private households and the gen- eral political conditions for private old-age pensions in the current legislative period’, said Weiler.
The GDV goes on to report that the premium income of life insurers and pension funds amounted to around 102 billion euros in the financial year ended. That amount is 1.4 per cent lower than in 2020. Whereas current pre- mium income increased slightly to 65.3 billion euros, one-time premiums declined to 36.5 billion euros (-4.7 per cent).
According to the GDV, new Riester business performed well with growth of 12 per cent to 310,500 contracts. The portfolio largely remained stable, with around 10.4 mil- lion contracts. With regard to basic pensions, the num- ber of newly brokered policies increased by almost 40 per cent to 119,000 contracts.

In the German-speaking market, the msg life Group is the market leader with the services and products it of- fers for life insurers and pension fund institutions and more than half of all leading life insurers in these coun- tries are its customers. The Group’s research and devel- opment activities are aimed at continuously reinforcing its leading position. With the regulatory requirements still changing constantly and the increasingly dynamic variety of products, insurance companies are increas- ingly pursuing a strategy of replacing their previous in- house software solutions with standard software.
msg life’s products and consulting services are now a fixed part of the msg Group’s portfolio for the insurance industry. And as an associated company in the msg Group, msg life is an even more significant strategic partner for its customers and an even more attractive employer for the employees.
Insurers’ expenses on IT also reflect the relevance of digitisation: according to the GDV, the insurance in- dustry invested around 5.6 billion euros in its IT in the 2020 financial year, compared to around 5.5 billion eu- ros in 2019. At 2.55 per cent, the IT cost ratio (the ratio of IT expenses to companies’ gross premium income) remained almost constant. According to the GDV publi-

Trustworthy AI and au- tomated machine learning are two topics that play an important role in this context.
The project breaks new technological ground and will create a fundamentally new hybrid technology at the point where machine learning, software development and actuarial mathematics intersect. The work ties in closely with the work in an ongoing migration project for an msg life customer and will be subsidised for three years by the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs, Re- gional Development and Energy (StMWi).

The main potential source of risk in the course of op- erating activity lies in the calculation of the complex projects and in their organisational, functional, techni- cal and commercial handling. These risks are controlled and monitored by means of the valid Group-wide stan- dards for project and project risk management. The risk nevertheless remains that projects cannot be realised profitably for the msg life Group because costs exceed the agreed budget, deadlines cannot be met or the ser- vices rendered fail to comply with the agreed functional specifications or the required quality, and the msg life Group will therefore have to grant a discount or pay com- pensation. The overall risk profile of all ongoing projects was further reduced in 2021. The existing risks of indi- vidual projects have been appropriately taken into ac- count for 2022. The cumulative occurrence in multiple projects could, however, lead to negative effects.
In the 2021 financial year, particular attention was paid to the potential impact of the current Covid-19 pan- demic on the company. The company was quick to take comprehensive action in order to remain operational including, in particular, providing all employees with the necessary hardware and software to work remotely from home and moving almost all work to cyberspace both quickly and consistently. Nevertheless, there is a risk that msg life employees fall ill and are unable to work on customer projects or that customers are unable to perform the necessary supporting services. In turn, it might not be possible to reach agreed project mile- stones on time or at all, resulting in a negative impact on the economic development of the company. Looking at the 2021 financial year, it is once again evident that
The msg life Group also uses software from external suppliers in its own software products. This third-par- ty software can contain defects that might have an adverse effect on the functional capability of the msg life Group’s own products.

msg life is also cultivating the Benelux market inten- sively from the German-speaking countries. After gain- ing AEGON in the Netherlands as a customer in 2020, msg life is generating interest there with its range of products, especially from insurance groups which op- erate nationally.

The development of msg life’s business with existing customers in that market was positive again in 2021 and it successfully managed to launch the project for its new customer, the non-life insurance company SegurCaixa Adeslas. Moreover, an acquisition was com- pleted successfully for Mutual Medica in Spain and the project began shortly after the end of the reporting peri- od. msg life continues to expect sales successes in that market in the current year.
msg life is serving the Central and Eastern European markets as well as other niche markets and segments from Slovenia in particular; as German-language in- surers are particularly striving to access these highly competitive markets, they regularly offer interesting sales opportunities for msg life. The company has a presence in many Eastern European countries with the Unified Administration Platform (UAP). As a result of the growing consulting business that is developing in connection with its local presences, msg life expects these markets to generate cross-selling effects. In the reporting period, SwissCaution awarded a contract to roll out the UAP. msg life received another contract for this system from Calingo Insurance AG in Switzerland, as well as from Zurich Cantonal Bank shortly after the end of the reporting period.
As previously reported, there were numerous new or- ders for msg life in 2021 and the company expects rele- vant new business in the 2022 financial year. Business with existing customers in connection with the software components was also strong. Additionally, nearly all of the major projects set out in the corporate plan were executed in the reporting period. As in previous years, msg life focused on sales projects in well-established markets in particular in the 2021 financial year.
During the reporting period, msg life continued to work on the introduction of an information security man- agement system (ISMS). Significant aspects of the es- tablishment of the ISMS are the definition and imple- mentation of more security guidelines in the software development process and other technical, HR and IT processes – with the objective of subsequent certifi- cation pursuant to the internationally recognised stan- dard ISO:IEC 27001. The internationally recognised in- stitute TÜV Rheinland is accompanying the process as certifying body.

Summarised evaluation of the company’s business situation
The 2021 financial year was another strong year for the msg life Group. Numerous sales successes with the cor- responding licence income, the very stable business with existing customers and continually low travel costs due to the still-ongoing coronavirus pandemic resulted in the targets set at the beginning of the financial year with regard to the financial key performance indicators of Group revenue from its own business (HGB) and Group earnings (HGB) being exceeded.
In the reporting period, the msg life Group recorded gross Group revenue from its own business under Ger- man GAAP of 176.1 million euros and Group earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) under German GAAP of 17.9 million euros.
The business situation of the company in the 2021 re- porting year can be described as positive overall. The foundations exist for positive development in 2022 and beyond. Last year’s prognosis in the separate financial statements forecast positive net results for the year; as the holding company, the individual Group company finished the 2021 financial year with net profit of 10.8 million euros.
Non-financial performance indicators
The msg life Group’s efficiency is reflected not only in its commercial indicators, but also in its non-financial per- formance indicators. The most important of these in the msg life Group are the issues that concern its employ- ees. The relevant disclosures can be found in the ‘Em- ployees’ chapter within this condensed management report and Group management report.

In connection with its ongoing internationalisation strategy, msg life and IBM have entered into a partner- ship to open up new insurance markets. The goal is to significantly increase the competitiveness of interna- tional insurance companies through a fully digitised end-to-end solution, thereby securing their future.
In the past, the strategic presence of msg life in each foreign market was an important success factor when it came to attracting new customers. It is also becoming more and more apparent that Group companies want to put the solutions implemented for one region at the disposal of other Group companies in other countries – which can advance the ongoing internationalisation of msg life as a service provider for its customers. Besides the established partnership with IBM, the objective in the 2022 financial year is to press ahead with ma- jor sales projects, especially in the established foreign markets, as in the 2021 financial year.
With regard to the US market, msg life is currently exam- ining whether it would be possible to deploy a localised version of its portfolio of European life insurance prod- ucts in connection with its specific US products as an integrated solution. Overall, msg life continues to enjoy steady growth in the various insurance sectors in the US market and intends to exploit the potential for business that this represents. In addition to the implementation and integration of specific software products, the range of services offered by msg life encompasses a variety of consulting services in connection with product and tar- iff modelling, for example, as well as operator models – these are generating growing interest in the market.

The development of msg life’s business with existing customers in that market was positive again in 2021 and it successfully managed to launch the project for its new customer, the non-life insurance company SegurCaixa Adeslas. Moreover, an acquisition was com- pleted successfully for Mutual Medica in Spain and the project began shortly after the end of the reporting peri- od. msg life continues to expect sales successes in that market in the current year.
msg life is serving the Central and Eastern European markets as well as other niche markets and segments from Slovenia in particular; as German-language in- surers are particularly striving to access these highly competitive markets, they regularly offer interesting sales opportunities for msg life. The company has a presence in many Eastern European countries with the Unified Administration Platform (UAP). As a result of the growing consulting business that is developing in connection with its local presences, msg life expects these markets to generate cross-selling effects. In the reporting period, SwissCaution awarded a contract to roll out the UAP. msg life received another contract for this system from Calingo Insurance AG in Switzerland, as well as from Zurich Cantonal Bank shortly after the end of the reporting period.
As previously reported, there were numerous new or- ders for msg life in 2021 and the company expects rele- vant new business in the 2022 financial year. Business with existing customers in connection with the software components was also strong. Additionally, nearly all of the major projects set out in the corporate plan were executed in the reporting period. As in previous years, msg life focused on sales projects in well-established markets in particular in the 2021 financial year.
During the reporting period, msg life continued to work on the introduction of an information security man- agement system (ISMS). Significant aspects of the es- tablishment of the ISMS are the definition and imple- mentation of more security guidelines in the software development process and other technical, HR and IT processes – with the objective of subsequent certifi- cation pursuant to the internationally recognised stan- dard ISO:IEC 27001. The internationally recognised in- stitute TÜV Rheinland is accompanying the process as certifying body.

In connection with its ongoing internationalisation strategy, msg life and IBM have entered into a partner- ship to open up new insurance markets. The goal is to significantly increase the competitiveness of interna- tional insurance companies through a fully digitised end-to-end solution, thereby securing their future.
In the past, the strategic presence of msg life in each foreign market was an important success factor when it came to attracting new customers. It is also becoming more and more apparent that Group companies want to put the solutions implemented for one region at the disposal of other Group companies in other countries – which can advance the ongoing internationalisation of msg life as a service provider for its customers. Besides the established partnership with IBM, the objective in the 2022 financial year is to press ahead with ma- jor sales projects, especially in the established foreign markets, as in the 2021 financial year.
With regard to the US market, msg life is currently exam- ining whether it would be possible to deploy a localised version of its portfolio of European life insurance prod- ucts in connection with its specific US products as an integrated solution. Overall, msg life continues to enjoy steady growth in the various insurance sectors in the US market and intends to exploit the potential for business that this represents. In addition to the implementation and integration of specific software products, the range of services offered by msg life encompasses a variety of consulting services in connection with product and tar- iff modelling, for example, as well as operator models – these are generating growing interest in the market.

Financial management is designed to enable the msg life Group to have the necessary funds at its disposal at all times so that it is capable of taking action in its operating activities to deal with volatility of incoming orders, fluctuations in customers’ payment behaviour and investment needs. In the process, all the significant risks to which the msg life Group is potentially exposed must be recognised at an early stage and the necessary scope for suitable protective measures provided for. Within the framework of liquidity management, care is taken that sufficient funds and appropriate liquidity re- serves are freely available at all times. In the financial year ended, the msg life Group was able to meet all pay- ment obligations in their entirety.
FINANCING ANALYSIS
The income and operating cash flows of the Group are not, on the whole, exposed to any interest rate risk. In general, liquid funds are invested for short periods. Fi- nancial liabilities are short to medium term in nature.
With regard to the credit risk (default risk), there are no significant concentrations on individual customers in the Group. Receivables are not insured, primarily due to the high credit rating of the customers in the insurance sector.

The Group’s assets position
ASSET STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
The 2021 financial year was above expectations. This development was caused by numerous sales successes with the corresponding licence income, stable business with existing customers and lower travel costs due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Management Board of msg life ag expects the earnings, financial and assets posi- tion of the company this year to remain at the same lev- el as in the previous year.
At 57.9 per cent, the equity ratio of the Group as at 31 December 2021 has undergone positive development compared to the previous year (previous year: 53.0 per cent) and equity amounted to 57.6 million euros (previ- ous year: 43.6 million euros). As at 31 December 2021, the Group’s total assets are 99.5 million euros (previ- ous year: 82.3 million euros), which represents an in- crease of 17.2 million euros.
Significant events influencing the earnings, financial and assets position of msg life ag in the annual financial statements pursuant to the German Commercial Code (HGB)
EARNINGS POSITION
In the reporting year, current assets increased from 74.5 million euros in the previous year to 92.3 million euros. Essentially, this development was due to the fact that securities were 12.4 million euros higher and accounts receivable were 6.9 million euros higher as at the re- porting date. On the other hand, liquid funds decreased by 5.0 million euros from 22.9 million euros to 17.9 mil- lion euros, which had the opposite effect.

///Retrieved document 2: The income and operating cash flows of the Group are not, on the whole, exposed to any interest rate risk. There are no significant interest rate risks in relation to its financial assets. The investment of cash and cash equivalents is done on a short-term basis and under- goes the normal market fluctuations. On the condition that all other parameters remained unchanged, the company assumes that interest rates were ten base points lower (higher) in the reporting period. In this case, the net result for 2021 would have been 8,000 euros lower (higher) (previous year: 8,000 euros lower (higher)) and the equity components would have been 8,000 euros lower (higher) (previous year: 8,000 euros lower (higher)).
In the reporting period as well as the previous year, there were no (interest-bearing) financial liabilities with variable interest rates.
Currency risks:
With regard to cash and cash equivalents, there is no concentration on individual institutions.
Overall assessment of the opportunities and risks
msg life believes that, in light of the likelihood of their occurrence and their effects, the risks described above do not represent a threat to the company’s continued existence either individually or as a whole. Senior man- agement remains confident that the Group’s earning power constitutes a solid basis for the future develop- ment of its business and will generate the resources that will be necessary for the Group to pursue the op- portunities that present themselves. In view of its lead- ing position on the market, its functional and techno- logical innovative power, its committed employees and its processes for the early identification of risks, msg life is confident that, in 2022, it will again be able to deal successfully with the challenges that arise from the aforementioned risks.
Currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in exchange rates.

///Retrieved document 1: With more than 1,200 employees at sites in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Slovakia, Slove- nia, Portugal, Spain and the United States, msg life is very well positioned in the field of software and consult- ing services for insurance companies and pension fund institutions. msg life’s wide range of digitised products and services for life insurance companies in Europe and, in particular, health and group insurance companies in the United States, gives it excellent market opportuni- ties and a promising competitive position.
In connection with its ongoing internationalisation strategy, msg life and IBM have entered into a partner- ship to open up new insurance markets. The goal is to significantly increase the competitiveness of interna- tional insurance companies through a fully digitised end-to-end solution, thereby securing their future.
In the past, the strategic presence of msg life in each foreign market was an important success factor when it came to attracting new customers. It is also becoming more and more apparent that Group companies want to put the solutions implemented for one region at the disposal of other Group companies in other countries – which can advance the ongoing internationalisation of msg life as a service provider for its customers. Besides the established partnership with IBM, the objective in the 2022 financial year is to press ahead with ma- jor sales projects, especially in the established foreign markets, as in the 2021 financial year.
With regard to the US market, msg life is currently exam- ining whether it would be possible to deploy a localised version of its portfolio of European life insurance prod- ucts in connection with its specific US products as an integrated solution. Overall, msg life continues to enjoy steady growth in the various insurance sectors in the US market and intends to exploit the potential for business that this represents. In addition to the implementation and integration of specific software products, the range of services offered by msg life encompasses a variety of consulting services in connection with product and tar- iff modelling, for example, as well as operator models – these are generating growing interest in the market.

///Retrieved document 2: Business with existing customers in 2021 was charac- terised by extremely stable, successful projects as well as a continuous flow of new contracts. The company ex- pects these developments to continue in 2022.
msg life was able to achieve sales successes in almost every region in which the company operated in 2021:
In the German-speaking market, the contracts for a proof of concept relating to the potential rollout of msg. Insurance Suite were signed with a well-known life in- surer and, shortly after the end of the reporting period, a start-up life insurer. Furthermore, the long-standing customer HUK-Coburg awarded contracts to roll out msg.RAN and msg.Tax Data. Likewise, the company was awarded contracts to roll out msg.Tax Data from Öffent- liche Versicherung Braunschweig and AXA Lebensver- sicherung AG. ERGO also placed an order to introduce msg.Life Product, the mathematical component of msg. Life Factory.
msg life is also cultivating the Benelux market inten- sively from the German-speaking countries. After gain- ing AEGON in the Netherlands as a customer in 2020, msg life is generating interest there with its range of products, especially from insurance groups which op- erate nationally.
The business of msg life in the United States for primar- ily health and group insurers was satisfactory up to the end of the reporting period. FJA-US, Inc. – the msg life Group company located in the United States – record- ed continuous successful development with solutions such as the Unified Distribution Platform, the Unified Product Platform and the web-based multi-channel platform msg.Sales. In the 2021 financial year, the com- pany attracted two new, well-known customers from the health and life insurance segments and recorded over- all growth in customer demand for services.
