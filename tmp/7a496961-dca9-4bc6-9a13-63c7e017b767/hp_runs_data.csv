With regard to Europe, the experts at the IMF expect the economy to grow by 5.0 per cent in 2021 and by 4.3 per cent this year. The forecasts of the OECD (Organisa- tion for Economic Co-operation and Development) are somewhat more optimistic: The experts expect growth of 5.2 per cent in the previous year and 4.3 per cent in 2022. According to the experts, new variants of Covid-19 and insufficient rates of vaccination are just two factors that represent risks. Additionally, economic stimulus packages are running out and corrections are looming on the property markets.

At 8.4 million euros (previous year: 8.9 million euros), personnel expenses were just 0.5 million euros lower than the previous year.
Provisions decreased by a total of 1.8 million euros to 25.8 million euros. Essentially, this change was due to the decrease in other provisions by 2.7 million euros to 17.7 million euros.
The item of depreciation of property, plant and equip- ment from the separate financial statements prepared in accordance with German GAAP (HGB) decreased slightly to 0.4 million euros in the financial year ended (previous year: 0.5 million euros).

The msg life companies generally assume the warranty which is customary in the indus- try. As far as possible, liability obligations are limited contractually to the legal minimum and are secured with appropriate liability insurance policies. It can neverthe- less not be entirely ruled out that contractually agreed limitations on liability will be regarded as invalid and the existing insurance cover will be available to an in- sufficient extent or not at all – even if this is improbable.

For this pur- pose, msg life has set up a monthly controlling and re- porting system.
The early risk detection system of msg life ag proved successful in 2021 as well and it was not necessary to revisit it. The entire procedure is described in the risk management manual and was approved by the Risk Board (risk manager and Management Board). The em- ployees responsible for this field were trained accord- ingly. As part of the ongoing ISO 27001 certification project, the management of information security risks has been expanded further within the overriding central risk management system.

Liquidity risks:
Managing liquidity risk includes ensuring that the com- pany always has sufficient liquid funds or credit lines available to enable it to meet its payment obligations and hedge against risks resulting from fluctuations in payment flows. Among other things, the payment ob- ligations consist of interest and redemption payments. Liquidity risk also includes the risk of not being able to obtain sufficient liquidity at the expected terms when required (refinancing risk).
Under the management mechanisms now in place, the daily holdings of cash and cash equivalents and the monthly rolling financial plans are monitored by the company’s management.

The company does not have any dependencies on the procurement side. On the sales side, there tend to be concentrations of risk due to the geographic distribu- tion of turnover. For example, Germany accounts for an 88.8 per cent share of turnover (previous year: 85.0 per cent).

In September 2021, the ECB decided to reduce the rate of PEPP purchases moderately. The ECB announced its decision at the most recent ECB meeting on 3 February 2022. At the same time, the ECB left the key interest rate in the Eurozone at 0 per cent, while the deposit facili- ty rate also remained unchanged at -0.5 per cent.

Market risks result from changes in market prices. These cause the fair values of financial instruments or future cash flows relating to them to fluctuate. Market risks encompass interest rate, currency and other price risks (such as commodity prices and share prices).
Price risks:
The msg life Group is not exposed to any price risks.
Information on risk concentration (concentration risks):
The company does not have any dependencies on the procurement side. On the sales side, there tend to be concentrations of risk due to the geographic distribu- tion of turnover. For example, Germany accounts for an 88.8 per cent share of turnover (previous year: 85.0 per cent).
Interest rate risks:
Interest rate risks result from a fluctuation in the fair val- ue or future cash flows of a financial instrument due to changes in market interest rates.

The purpose of liquidity man- agement is to finance predictable deficits at standard market terms under normal market conditions. This means that losses from both borrowing capital at exces- sive interest rates as well as investing surplus funds at interest rates below the market level should be avoided.
Credit risks (default risks):
Credit risk arises from deteriorating economic circum- stances of the company’s debtors or counterparties. Firstly, this results in a risk of partial or complete default on contractually agreed payments and, secondly, in a reduction in the value of financial instruments due to a poorer credit rating.

IV. Notes on the statement of financial position
1. Fixed assets
The development of fixed assets in the financial year and in the previous year, in- cluding their breakdown, is presented separately in the consolidated statement of changes in fixed assets (see Appendix to the notes).
The intangible assets are essentially software purchased from third parties.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over an expected useful life. The expected useful life of software purchased from third parties is between three and 15 years.
The disposal in the financial assets concerns an interest in ARGE FJA KR BU-System, Munich, which has not been consolidated. The msg life Group had few means of par- ticipating in the financial and business decision-making processes of the company and as such has no significant influence over the company.

IV. Notes on the statement of financial position
1. Fixed assets
The development of fixed assets in the financial year and in the previous year, in- cluding their breakdown, is presented separately in the consolidated statement of changes in fixed assets (see Appendix to the notes).
The intangible assets are essentially software purchased from third parties.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over an expected useful life. The expected useful life of software purchased from third parties is between three and 15 years.
The disposal in the financial assets concerns an interest in ARGE FJA KR BU-System, Munich, which has not been consolidated. The msg life Group had few means of par- ticipating in the financial and business decision-making processes of the company and as such has no significant influence over the company.

///Retrieved document 2: Inventories are measured at historical cost. Apart from the unit costs, the costs of production also include an appropriate proportion of the overhead costs and write- downs. The loss-free valuation rule is observed. Work contracts which extend across multiple financial years are treated as work in progress until the milestone is deliv- ered, fully or in part, to the customer. Advance payments received on account of or- ders are written off openly from inventories.
Accounts receivable and other assets are valued at their face value as a matter of prin- ciple. Receivables with terms exceeding one year are deducted. A lump-sum valuation adjustment amounting to 0.5% of the net accounts receivable is established for the general credit risk and to cover loss of interest, provided that no payments on account have been made.
Marketable securities are recognised at the lower of historical cost or fair value on the reporting date.
Cash in hand, bank balances and cheques are recognised at their nominal amount.

The purpose of liquidity man- agement is to finance predictable deficits at standard market terms under normal market conditions. This means that losses from both borrowing capital at exces- sive interest rates as well as investing surplus funds at interest rates below the market level should be avoided.
Credit risks (default risks):
Credit risk arises from deteriorating economic circum- stances of the company’s debtors or counterparties. Firstly, this results in a risk of partial or complete default on contractually agreed payments and, secondly, in a reduction in the value of financial instruments due to a poorer credit rating.

Pension agreements exist for the parent company and for one domestic and one for- eign subsidiary within the msg life Group in the form of direct defined-benefit ob- ligations. In defined-benefit plans, the employer undertakes to make the promised pension payments and to finance them by forming pension provisions or separate plan assets for pension purposes.
Provisions for pension obligations are formed on the basis of plans for retirement, incapacity and survivors’ benefit. Group pension obligations to employees are based on direct and indirect pension commitments. Benefits from direct pension obliga- tions are fundamentally determined as a function of monthly salary and length of service with the company.

///Retrieved document 2: At the time of writing of the condensed management report and Group management report, the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 on the general economic and sector-specific conditions in the current 2022 financial year and beyond was not yet evident and has therefore not been taken into account in the follow- ing disclosures regarding both subject areas.
With regard to Europe, the experts at the IMF expect the economy to grow by 5.0 per cent in 2021 and by 4.3 per cent this year. The forecasts of the OECD (Organisa- tion for Economic Co-operation and Development) are somewhat more optimistic: The experts expect growth of 5.2 per cent in the previous year and 4.3 per cent in 2022. According to the experts, new variants of Covid-19 and insufficient rates of vaccination are just two factors that represent risks. Additionally, economic stimulus packages are running out and corrections are looming on the property markets.

Income received prior to the reporting date is recognised under accruals and deferrals as long as it represents revenue for a specific time after the reporting date.
The deferred taxes are calculated in line with the temporary concept. According to the temporary concept, deferred taxes are formed for all temporary and virtually per- manent accounting and measurement differences between the values of assets and liabilities recognised under commercial and tax law.

2. Consolidation principles
Capital is consolidated according to the purchase method of accounting.
Any difference remaining on the assets side after netting is recognised as goodwill on the assets side and amortised over its conventional useful life of five years.
There is no more goodwill to recognise in the 2021 financial year, following the decon- solidation of the shares in spheos GmbH & Co. KG, Munich, and spheos Verwaltungs GmbH, Munich, in the previous year.
Receivables and payables are offset in the consolidated financial statements by elim- inating the receivables and the corresponding payables between the companies in- cluded in the consolidated financial statements.

Although insurers did have to accept larger drops in profits and premiums in some cases, the industry was in good over- all condition when it was hit by the crisis, enabling it to mostly remain profitable. Even the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) describes the European insurance industry as ‘fundamentally ro- bust’. This is demonstrated by the results of the stress test 2021 that were published in December 2021. The test included 43 major European insurance groups, in- cluding five from Germany.

The developments in insurance products described above are typically not associated with particular product families. The plat- form economy is also playing a key role in the insurance industry this year: numerous insurers are now using platforms and ecosystems to provide digital products and services beyond what had previously been their core business – this in turn is opening up new ways to create value.

The use of AI (and automated ma- chine learning at its heart) not only improves efficiency through automation, but also facilitates new technical approaches which in turn pave the way for entirely new business models, services and products. In connection with AI, insurers are also concentrating on robo-advis- ers, advanced analytics and blockchain.
For one, msg life is responding to this with the TRAIL.X project, where deep neural networks (DNNs) are being developed for the actuarial computation module in cooperation with the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. These DNNs will enable life insurers to replace old system generations, map their core functions with artificial intelligence and integrate them into a modern system.

IV. Notes on the statement of financial position
1. Fixed assets
The development of fixed assets in the financial year and in the previous year, in- cluding their breakdown, is presented separately in the consolidated statement of changes in fixed assets (see Appendix to the notes).
The intangible assets are essentially software purchased from third parties.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over an expected useful life. The expected useful life of software purchased from third parties is between three and 15 years.
The disposal in the financial assets concerns an interest in ARGE FJA KR BU-System, Munich, which has not been consolidated. The msg life Group had few means of par- ticipating in the financial and business decision-making processes of the company and as such has no significant influence over the company.

0,The forecast for global economic growth in 2022 is expected to be around 4.1% according to the World Bank and 4.4% according to the IMF.,"///Retrieved document 0: The Covid-19 pandemic continues to overshadow in- ternational economic activity. According to the Global Economic Prospect Report published by the World Bank in January 2022, the global economy is in a distinct de- cline compounded by new variants of Covid-19 as well as high inflation, debt and income inequality, following a strong upturn in 2021. Economists expect the global growth rate to fall from 5.5 per cent in 2021 to 4.1 per cent this year. The World Bank expects it to increase by 3.2 per cent in 2023.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently down- graded the forecast it released last October in its up- dated World Economic Outlook in January 2022. The IMF expects the global economy to grow by just 4.4 per cent this year, following growth of 5.9 per cent last year – 0.5 per cent less than initially forecast. The IMF attributes this to the current Covid-19 situation, supply bottle- necks and the high rate of inflation. Like the World Bank, the IMF predicts growth of 3.2 per cent in 2023.

With regard to life insur- ance, the Covid-19 pandemic can be expected to have an impact on business prospects in the current year too. Premium growth of between 1 and 2 per cent could be considered realistic here. The GDV expects a weaker performance from traditional life insurance products, although market-oriented products are expected to grow more strongly. ‘The decisive factors here are the economic prospects of private households and the gen- eral political conditions for private old-age pensions in the current legislative period’, said Weiler.

In 2021, foreign trade recovered from the dramatic set- back it suffered in 2020. Germany exported 9.4 per cent more goods and services abroad than in the same pe- riod in the previous year. Imports grew by 8.6 per cent. This means that foreign trade in 2021 was only slightly below the level it had reached in 2019.

After the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act suffered from a lack of support from the Trump administration, the Biden administra- tion pressed on with an improvement to the Patient Pro- tection and Affordable Care Act in late 2021 in the form of the Build Back Better Act. As a result, state healthcare programmes such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid can be expected to grow further. Thanks to its now well-established partnerships with leading providers such as Companion Data Services, the msg life Group company in the USA can offer end-to-end ser- vices including claims handling. Additionally, the com- pany successfully expanded its related activities in the health and group insurance market and further diversi- fied its range of services.

Capital is consolidated according to the purchase method of accounting.
Any difference remaining on the assets side after netting is recognised as goodwill on the assets side and amortised over its conventional useful life of five years.
There is no more goodwill to recognise in the 2021 financial year, following the decon- solidation of the shares in spheos GmbH & Co. KG, Munich, and spheos Verwaltungs GmbH, Munich, in the previous year.
Receivables and payables are offset in the consolidated financial statements by elim- inating the receivables and the corresponding payables between the companies in- cluded in the consolidated financial statements.

1,"Some key developments in the insurance industry include the industry remaining profitable during the pandemic, the industry being described as fundamentally robust by EIOPA, and the focus on innovative products that meet the needs of both policyholders and insurers.","///Retrieved document 0: In Europe, the insurance industry largely managed to remain on track in 2020, the first year of the pandemic, according to the European Insurance Study 2021 pub- lished by Zeb Consulting in December 2021. Although insurers did have to accept larger drops in profits and premiums in some cases, the industry was in good over- all condition when it was hit by the crisis, enabling it to mostly remain profitable. Even the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) describes the European insurance industry as ‘fundamentally ro- bust’. This is demonstrated by the results of the stress test 2021 that were published in December 2021. The test included 43 major European insurance groups, in- cluding five from Germany.

The IMF expects the global economy to grow by just 4.4 per cent this year, following growth of 5.9 per cent last year – 0.5 per cent less than initially forecast. The IMF attributes this to the current Covid-19 situation, supply bottle- necks and the high rate of inflation. Like the World Bank, the IMF predicts growth of 3.2 per cent in 2023.

IV. Notes on the statement of financial position
1. Fixed assets
The development of fixed assets in the financial year and in the previous year, in- cluding their breakdown, is presented separately in the consolidated statement of changes in fixed assets (see Appendix to the notes).
The intangible assets are essentially software purchased from third parties.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over an expected useful life. The expected useful life of software purchased from third parties is between three and 15 years.
The disposal in the financial assets concerns an interest in ARGE FJA KR BU-System, Munich, which has not been consolidated. The msg life Group had few means of par- ticipating in the financial and business decision-making processes of the company and as such has no significant influence over the company.

Depreciable movable fixed assets that can be used independently and whose (net) costs per indi- vidual item exceed 250 euros, but not 800 euros, qualify as low-value assets and are immediately recognised as expenses in the year of acquisition.

Although insurers did have to accept larger drops in profits and premiums in some cases, the industry was in good over- all condition when it was hit by the crisis, enabling it to mostly remain profitable. Even the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) describes the European insurance industry as ‘fundamentally ro- bust’. This is demonstrated by the results of the stress test 2021 that were published in December 2021. The test included 43 major European insurance groups, in- cluding five from Germany.

The aforementioned targets are based on circumstanc- es prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February of this year and the resulting economic sanctions against Russia. It is impossible to judge the effects of this cri- sis on the course of business of the msg life Group in 2022. At the time of preparation of the annual financial statements, however, msg life does not expect any sig- nificant changes to its economic or operational devel- opment, and is therefore currently not deviating from the above targets for 2022.

Access restrictions prevent potentially infected software from being installed on the msg life comput- er network without authorisation. Defined security re- quirements limit access by unauthorised persons and ensure that data is protected. Financial loss is limited by appropriate insurance policies.

As a result, state healthcare programmes such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid can be expected to grow further. Thanks to its now well-established partnerships with leading providers such as Companion Data Services, the msg life Group company in the USA can offer end-to-end ser- vices including claims handling.
