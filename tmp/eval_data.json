        "answer": "Some key developments in the insurance industry include the proposed revision of the regulatory regime Solvency II by the European Commission, the introduction of the Transparency Directive for financial service providers, the implementation of a digital pension overview by the German government, the launch of a voluntary Pan-European Pension Product (PEPP), and the acceleration of digitization in the industry due to the Covid-19 crisis.",

In 2021, the European Commission presented its proposed revi- sion of the regulatory regime Solvency II which has been in force since 2016.

According to the GDV, the amendments should remain balanced because Solvency II has proven itself so far.\n\ncation \u2018Insurance IT: A key to greater sustainability\u2019 pub- lished in January 2022, software standardisation, the replacement of legacy systems and cloud computing are among the most important IT projects. According to Branchenkompass Insurance 2021, the replacement of legacy systems with cloud computing IT is considered a recurring theme in the industry. It reports that more than 60 per cent of insurers are currently working to mi- grate to cloud-based solutions.\n\nIn March 2021, the European Commission introduced the Transparency Directive (Sustainable Finance Dis- closure Regulation; SFDR) for financial service provid- ers. The directive governs the disclosure obligations of pro duct providers and financial advisors in terms of sustainability in strategies, processes and products. The regulatory requirements also apply to insurance brokers, life insurers and providers of company pension schemes. The Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) that expand on the directive are expected to apply from mid- 2022 onwards. This will increase the amount of regula- tory paperwork for life insurers and providers of compa- ny pension schemes.\n\nWith regard to old-age pensions, the German govern- ment has also decided to introduce a digital pension overview. It aims to provide customers with a quick over- view of their statutory, company and private pension en- titlements. The German Pension Overview Act (Rent\u00dcG) came into effect on 18 February 2021. The law requires all providers of private and company old-age pensions to connect to the portal if they are obliged to send regu- lar summaries to their customers while they are paying into the pension. After a 21-month development phase, the platform is set to go live in autumn 2023.\n\nFinally, the launch of a voluntary Pan-European Pen- sion Product (PEPP) has been decided on a European level. The regulatory technical standards were defined in March 2021. PEPP is to be available throughout Eu- rope, although providers will have to meet strict criteria before they are permitted to offer it. The European pen- sion is designed to be complementary to existing state, statutory and occupational pension systems. Potential providers of the pension include insurance companies, company pension funds, banks and administrators of alternative investment funds.\n\nDigitisation also remains at the top of the agenda for the German insurance industry. In particular, digitisa- tion has been accelerated greatly by the Covid-19 crisis. Digitised business processes enable the ever-greater integration of systems across divisions, segments and company boundaries. That makes it possible to exploit the potential represented by the standardisation and automation of processes to a greater extent. Fully auto- mated processes lead to enormous gains with regard to efficiency as well as significantly lower costs.\n\nIn Europe, the insurance industry largely managed to remain on track in 2020, the first year of the pandemic, according to the European Insurance Study 2021 pub- lished by Zeb Consulting in December 2021. Although insurers did have to accept larger drops in profits and premiums in some cases, the industry was in good over- all condition when it was hit by the crisis, enabling it to mostly remain profitable. Even the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) describes the European insurance industry as \u2018fundamentally ro- bust\u2019. This is demonstrated by the results of the stress test 2021 that were published in December 2021. The test included 43 major European insurance groups, in- cluding five from Germany.\n\nLikewise, insurers in the USA have survived the crisis rel- atively well. This is the conclusion of the article entitled \u2018Der Versicherungsmarkt USA im Blick\u2019 (\u2018A look at the US insurance market\u2019) published by the R&D service pro- vider Versicherungsforen Leipzig in December 2021. It states that gross premiums grew by 0.6 per cent overall in 2020. Although growth of 1.2 per cent was achieved in the non-life segment, life premiums decreased by 1.4 per cent.

Essentially, this development was due to the fact that securities were 12.4 million euros higher and accounts receivable were 6.9 million euros higher as at the re- porting date. On the other hand, liquid funds decreased by 5.0 million euros from 22.9 million euros to 17.9 mil- lion euros, which had the opposite effect.\n\nCompared to the previous year, turnover decreased by 6.5 million euros from 56.5 million euros to 50.0 million euros. This development was driven by turnover from third parties which decreased by 9.4 million euros, and internal turnover (i.e. turnover from companies within the msg life Group) which increased by 2.9 million eu- ros. Other operating income came to 0.4 million euros (previous year: 0.6 million euros).\n\nThe net total of the line item \u2018Inventories\u2019 has increased from 4.3 million euros to 7.5 million euros as payments received on account and work in progress exceeded the payments received on account of customer projects as at the reporting date. Due to the chosen method of open recognition, the net amount of 7.5 million euros has been recognised under inventories.\n\nNon-current assets decreased on the whole by 1.5 mil- lion euros, from 6.6 million euros in the previous year to 5.1 million euros. In the 2021 financial year, proper- ty, plant and equipment decreased by 1.1 million euros. Overall, intangible assets decreased by 0.4 million eu- ros to 1.0 million euros. Before they were netted against deferred tax liabilities, the deferred tax assets totalled 0.3 million euros (previous year: 0.4 million euros).\n\nExpenses for the procurement of services were 11.6 mil- lion euros lower than in the previous year and amount- ed to 28.4 million euros in the financial year ended (pre- vious year: 40.0 million euros)."

As at 31 December 2021, the Group\u2019s total assets are 99.5 million euros (previ- ous year: 82.3 million euros), which represents an in- crease of 17.2 million euros.\n\nSignificant events influencing the earnings, financial and assets position of msg life ag in the annual financial statements pursuant to the German Commercial Code (HGB)\n\nEARNINGS POSITION\n\nIn the reporting year, current assets increased from 74.5 million euros in the previous year to 92.3 million euros. Essentially, this development was due to the fact that securities were 12.4 million euros higher and accounts receivable were 6.9 million euros higher as at the re- porting date. On the other hand, liquid funds decreased by 5.0 million euros from 22.9 million euros to 17.9 mil- lion euros, which had the opposite effect.\n\nCompared to the previous year, turnover decreased by 6.5 million euros from 56.5 million euros to 50.0 million euros. This development was driven by turnover from third parties which decreased by 9.4 million euros, and internal turnover (i.e. turnover from companies within the msg life Group) which increased by 2.9 million eu- ros. Other operating income came to 0.4 million euros (previous year: 0.6 million euros).\n\nThe net total of the line item \u2018Inventories\u2019 has increased from 4.3 million euros to 7.5 million euros as payments received on account and work in progress exceeded the payments received on account of customer projects as at the reporting date. Due to the chosen method of open recognition, the net amount of 7.5 million euros has been recognised under inventories.\n\nNon-current assets decreased on the whole by 1.5 mil- lion euros, from 6.6 million euros in the previous year to 5.1 million euros. In the 2021 financial year, proper- ty, plant and equipment decreased by 1.1 million euros. Overall, intangible assets decreased by 0.4 million eu- ros to 1.0 million euros. Before they were netted against deferred tax liabilities, the deferred tax assets totalled 0.3 million euros (previous year: 0.4 million euros).\n\nExpenses for the procurement of services were 11.6 mil- lion euros lower than in the previous year and amount- ed to 28.4 million euros in the financial year ended (pre- vious year: 40.0 million euros)."

Essentially, this change was due to the decrease in other provisions by 2.7 million euros to 17.7 million euros.\n\nThe item of depreciation of property, plant and equip- ment from the separate financial statements prepared in accordance with German GAAP (HGB) decreased slightly to 0.4 million euros in the financial year ended (previous year: 0.5 million euros).\n\nAll in all, provisions account for 25.9 per cent of the balance sheet total, compared with 33.6 per cent in the previous year.\n\nLiabilities amounted to 13.2 million euros. The increase of 4.4 million euros compared to the previous year is due to the increase in liabilities to affiliated companies of 3.6 million euros to 7.5 million euros, an increase in trade payables of 1.5 million euros and the decrease in other liabilities by 0.7 million euros to 2.6 million euros.\n\nOther operating expenses, mostly consisting of admin- istrative costs with affiliated companies, rent and legal and consultancy costs, bookkeeping costs and Supervi- sory Board remuneration, increased by 1.5 million euros from 17.1 million euros to 18.6 million euros in the finan- cial year ended.\n\nmsg life\n\nrethinking insurance\n\nAnnual Report 2021\n\n19\n\nUnder its profit transfer agreements, the company re- ceived 16.1 million euros from msg life central europe gmbh (previous year: 14.6 million euros) and 1.0 million euros of income from msg life global gmbh (previous year: 0.8 million euros).\n\nlargely due to an increase in advance payments made within the framework of a major project with msg sys- tems ag, as well as trade receivables as at 31 December 2021.\n\nIn the 2021 financial year, as in the previous year, the net interest result of msg life ag amounted to -0.4 mil- lion euros and mainly comprises interest expenses for pension and anniversary provisions or accrued interest on IC liabilities to affiliated companies.\n\nIncome tax expenses amounted to 0.9 million euros in the 2021 financial year (previous year: 0.3 million eu- ros).\n\nOverall, for the 2021 financial year, msg life ag gener- ated a net profit under the German Commercial Code (HGB) in the amount of 10.8 million euros (previous year: 5.2 million euros).\n\nTrade receivables increased by 7.9 million euros to 10.2 million euros (previous year: 2.3 million euros).\n\nReceivables from affiliated companies increased by 1.9 million euros to 3.7 million euros (previous year: 1.8 million euros).

        "answer": "In the 2021 financial year, msg life faces several risks. One of the main risks is the potential impact of the current Covid-19 pandemic on the company. To mitigate this risk, the company has taken comprehensive action by providing employees with the necessary hardware and software to work remotely from home. However, there is still a risk that employees may fall ill and be unable to work on customer projects, or that customers may be unable to perform necessary supporting services, which could result in delays or negative impacts on the company's economic development. Another risk is the use of third-party software in msg life's own software products, which may contain defects that could affect the functionality of the company's products. Problems in project execution and software defects can also damage the company's reputation. Additionally, msg life faces personnel risks, as its success depends on the skills, qualifications, and motivation of its employees. If the company is unable to retain key employees or recruit qualified and skilled employees, it may suffer adverse effects. The company also faces the risk of an excessive burden on its own employees, which may require the deployment of expensive external capacities. Finally, msg life is exposed to economic risks, as the general economic trend can affect customer behavior and investment in IT infrastructure and management consulting. An economic downturn could reduce the market volume and lead to restructuring costs.",
