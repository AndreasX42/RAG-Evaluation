These risks are controlled and monitored by means of the valid Group-wide standards for project and project risk management. However, there is still a risk that projects cannot be realized profitably because costs exceed the agreed budget, deadlines cannot be met, or the services rendered fail to comply with the agreed functional specifications or required quality. In such cases, the msg life Group may have to grant a discount or pay compensation. The overall risk profile of all ongoing projects was further reduced in 2021, and the existing risks of individual projects have been appropriately taken into account for 2022. However, the cumulative occurrence of risks in multiple projects could lead to negative effects.",

        "answer": "In the 2021 financial year, msg life faces several risks. One of the main risks is the potential impact of the current Covid-19 pandemic on the company. To mitigate this risk, the company has taken comprehensive action by providing employees with the necessary hardware and software to work remotely from home. However, there is still a risk that employees may fall ill and be unable to work on customer projects, or that customers may be unable to perform necessary supporting services, which could result in delays or negative impacts on the company's economic development. Another risk is the use of third-party software in msg life's own software products, which may contain defects that could affect the functionality of the company's products. Problems in project execution and software defects can also damage the company's reputation. Additionally, msg life faces personnel risks, as its success depends on the skills, qualifications, and motivation of its employees. If the company is unable to retain key employees or recruit qualified and skilled employees, it may suffer adverse effects. The company also faces the risk of an excessive burden on its own employees, which may require the deployment of expensive external capacities. Finally, msg life is exposed to economic risks, as the general economic trend can affect customer behavior and investment in IT infrastructure and management consulting. An economic downturn could reduce the market volume and lead to restructuring costs.",
