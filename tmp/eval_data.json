Economists expect the global growth rate to fall from 5.5% in 2021 to 4.1% in 2022. The World Bank predicts a growth rate of 3.2% in 2023. The IMF also downgraded its forecast, expecting the global economy to grow by 4.4% in 2022, following growth of 5.9% in 2021.

            "context": "The Covid-19 pandemic continues to overshadow in- ternational economic activity. According to the Global Economic Prospect Report published by the World Bank in January 2022, the global economy is in a distinct de- cline compounded by new variants of Covid-19 as well as high inflation, debt and income inequality, following a strong upturn in 2021. Economists expect the global growth rate to fall from 5.5 per cent in 2021 to 4.1 per cent this year. The World Bank expects it to increase by 3.2 per cent in 2023.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently down- graded the forecast it released last October in its up- dated World Economic Outlook in January 2022. The IMF expects the global economy to grow by just 4.4 per cent this year, following growth of 5.9 per cent last year \u2013 0.5 per cent less than initially forecast. The IMF attributes this to the current Covid-19 situation, supply bottle- necks and the high rate of inflation. Like the World Bank, the IMF predicts growth of 3.2 per cent in 2023.\n\nThe IMF has downgraded its forecast by 1.2 percentage points to 4 per cent for the USA this year, the world\u2019s largest economy. The IMF has even downgraded its fore- cast by 0.8 percentage points to 4.8 per cent for China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nAccording to the IMF, the dramatic rise in inflation will remain high in 2022 due to ongoing supply difficulties and high energy prices. The organisation expects in- dustrialised nations to see an average inflation rate of 3.9 per cent. The average rate of inflation in developing countries and emerging economies is expected to be 5.9 per cent.\n\nAccording to the calculations of the Federal Statistical Office, Germany\u2019s GDP grew by 2.8 per cent in 2021 after having fallen by 4.6 per cent in the same period in the previous year. \u2018After economic performance had increased again last summer despite growing delivery bottlenecks and material shortages, the recovery of the German economy came to a halt at the end of the year due to the fourth Covid-19 wave and another reinforce- ment of Covid-19 preventive measures\u2019, reported the Federal Statistical Office in January 2022. Compared to the crisis in 2020, economic performance improved in almost every area in 2021. However, it has not yet reached its pre-crisis level.\n\nThe economic performance of the manufacturing sector improved by 4.4 per cent year-on-year. The aggregated economic sector of trade, transport, accommodation and food services saw growth of just 3.0 per cent. Fol- lowing growth of 3.8 per cent in 2020, the construction sector reported a slight decline of 0.4 per cent. Other services, which include culture, entertainment, sports and creative activities, were hit particularly hard by the crisis: Their economic performance grew by just 0.6 per cent, following a decline of 10.5 per cent in the same period in the previous year.\n\nIn 2021, foreign trade recovered from the dramatic set- back it suffered in 2020. Germany exported 9.4 per cent more goods and services abroad than in the same pe- riod in the previous year. Imports grew by 8.6 per cent. This means that foreign trade in 2021 was only slightly below the level it had reached in 2019.\n\nThe German government expects the country\u2019s econom- ic recovery to accelerate over the course of the year. That being said, it is set to be less strong than initial- ly predicted. \u2018The impact of the coronavirus pandemic\n\nmsg life\n\nrethinking insurance\n\nAnnual Report 2021\n\n13\n\ncontinues to be felt\u2019, says a press release published by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action in January 2022. In spite of this, the economy re- mains \u2018robust\u2019. The GDP is expected to grow by 3.6 per cent year-on-year. As such, economic performance will surpass its pre-crisis levels for the first time. As recent- ly as December 2021, major German economic institu- tions downgraded their forecasts for 2022. For example, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy lowered its GDP forecast from 5.1 per cent to 4.0 per cent and the Halle Institute for Economic Research downgraded its growth forecast from 4.8 per cent to 3.5 per cent."

According to the Global Economic Prospect Report published by the World Bank in January 2022, the global economy is in a distinct de- cline compounded by new variants of Covid-19 as well as high inflation, debt and income inequality, following a strong upturn in 2021. Economists expect the global growth rate to fall from 5.5 per cent in 2021 to 4.1 per cent this year. The World Bank expects it to increase by 3.2 per cent in 2023.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently down- graded the forecast it released last October in its up- dated World Economic Outlook in January 2022. The IMF expects the global economy to grow by just 4.4 per cent this year, following growth of 5.9 per cent last year \u2013 0.5 per cent less than initially forecast. The IMF attributes this to the current Covid-19 situation, supply bottle- necks and the high rate of inflation. Like the World Bank, the IMF predicts growth of 3.2 per cent in 2023.\n\nThe IMF has downgraded its forecast by 1.2 percentage points to 4 per cent for the USA this year, the world\u2019s largest economy. The IMF has even downgraded its fore- cast by 0.8 percentage points to 4.8 per cent for China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nAccording to the IMF, the dramatic rise in inflation will remain high in 2022 due to ongoing supply difficulties and high energy prices. The organisation expects in- dustrialised nations to see an average inflation rate of 3.9 per cent. The average rate of inflation in developing countries and emerging economies is expected to be 5.9 per cent.\n\nAccording to the calculations of the Federal Statistical Office, Germany\u2019s GDP grew by 2.8 per cent in 2021 after having fallen by 4.6 per cent in the same period in the previous year. \u2018After economic performance had increased again last summer despite growing delivery bottlenecks and material shortages, the recovery of the German economy came to a halt at the end of the year due to the fourth Covid-19 wave and another reinforce- ment of Covid-19 preventive measures\u2019, reported the Federal Statistical Office in January 2022. Compared to the crisis in 2020, economic performance improved in almost every area in 2021. However, it has not yet reached its pre-crisis level.\n\nThe economic performance of the manufacturing sector improved by 4.4 per cent year-on-year. The aggregated economic sector of trade, transport, accommodation and food services saw growth of just 3.0 per cent. Fol- lowing growth of 3.8 per cent in 2020, the construction sector reported a slight decline of 0.4 per cent. Other services, which include culture, entertainment, sports and creative activities, were hit particularly hard by the crisis: Their economic performance grew by just 0.6 per cent, following a decline of 10.5 per cent in the same period in the previous year.\n\nIn 2021, foreign trade recovered from the dramatic set- back it suffered in 2020. Germany exported 9.4 per cent more goods and services abroad than in the same pe- riod in the previous year. Imports grew by 8.6 per cent. This means that foreign trade in 2021 was only slightly below the level it had reached in 2019.\n\nThe German government expects the country\u2019s econom- ic recovery to accelerate over the course of the year. That being said, it is set to be less strong than initial- ly predicted. \u2018The impact of the coronavirus pandemic\n\nmsg life\n\nrethinking insurance\n\nAnnual Report 2021\n\n13\n\ncontinues to be felt\u2019, says a press release published by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action in January 2022. In spite of this, the economy re- mains \u2018robust\u2019. The GDP is expected to grow by 3.6 per cent year-on-year. As such, economic performance will surpass its pre-crisis levels for the first time. As recent- ly as December 2021, major German economic institu- tions downgraded their forecasts for 2022. For example, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy lowered its GDP forecast from 5.1 per cent to 4.0 per cent and the Halle Institute for Economic Research downgraded its growth forecast from 4.8 per cent to 3.5 per cent."

He announced that insurers reported an increase in premiums of 1.1 per cent (previous year: 1.6 per cent) across all segments, reaching 223.4 billion euros.\n\nThe outlook for 2022 is cautiously optimistic. Accord- ing to the GDV, the industry expects premium growth of between 2 and 3 per cent. With regard to life insur- ance, the Covid-19 pandemic can be expected to have an impact on business prospects in the current year too. Premium growth of between 1 and 2 per cent could be considered realistic here. The GDV expects a weaker performance from traditional life insurance products, although market-oriented products are expected to grow more strongly. \u2018The decisive factors here are the economic prospects of private households and the gen- eral political conditions for private old-age pensions in the current legislative period\u2019, said Weiler.\n\nThe GDV goes on to report that the premium income of life insurers and pension funds amounted to around 102 billion euros in the financial year ended. That amount is 1.4 per cent lower than in 2020. Whereas current pre- mium income increased slightly to 65.3 billion euros, one-time premiums declined to 36.5 billion euros (-4.7 per cent).\n\nAccording to the GDV, new Riester business performed well with growth of 12 per cent to 310,500 contracts. The portfolio largely remained stable, with around 10.4 mil- lion contracts. With regard to basic pensions, the num- ber of newly brokered policies increased by almost 40 per cent to 119,000 contracts. This caused the overall portfolio to grow by 4 per cent to 2.5 million contracts.\n\nThe rating agency Moody\u2019s is confident about German life insurers: \u2018The pressure on life insurance is lifting gradually\u2019, said Christian Badorff, a credit analyst at Moody\u2019s, according to the business newspaper Han- delsblatt in October 2021. Although the industry is still under pressure in 2022 due to low interest rates, it is set to stabilise. Moody\u2019s has upgraded its outlook for the sector from negative to stable. Life insurers are increas- ingly shifting new business to products that protect cap- ital, it continues. Additionally, the additional interest reserves have suppressed the risks of their long-term interest guarantees.\n\nThe persistently low interest rates were a concern of the insurance industry in the 2021 financial year as well. The ECB launched a multi-billion-euro emergen- cy purchase programme in March 2020 to mitigate the severe economic impacts of the Covid-19 crisis: under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), the ECB will purchase up to 1.85 billion euros\u2019 worth of government and corporate bonds until March 2022 at the earliest.\n\nIn September 2021, the ECB decided to reduce the rate of PEPP purchases moderately. The ECB announced its decision at the most recent ECB meeting on 3 February 2022. At the same time, the ECB left the key interest rate in the Eurozone at 0 per cent, while the deposit facili- ty rate also remained unchanged at -0.5 per cent. This means that banks must continue to pay penalty rates if they deposit surplus money with the ECB.\n\nIn light of the rapid rise in inflation, ECB President Christine Lagarde refused to rule out an interest rate increase this year. As such, the ECB is prepared to ad- just all available instruments in order to reach its 2 per cent inflation target in the medium term. Lagarde made an announcement to this effect at the press conference afterwards. According to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, the rate of inflation in Eurozone countries rose from 5.0 per cent in December 2021 to 5.1 per cent in January 2022. High energy costs were the main driver. According to the Federal Statistical Office, inflation in Germany fell to 4.9 per cent in January 2022 from 5.3 per cent in the previous month."

        "question": "Why did the Federal Ministry of Finance decide to lower the projected interest rate for new life insurance contracts?",
        "answer": "The Federal Ministry of Finance decided to lower the projected interest rate for new life insurance contracts from 0.9 per cent to 0.25 per cent from 1 January 2022 onwards due to the persistently low interest rates. The German actuarial association Deutsche Aktuarvereinigung (DAV) had called for this change as extensive premium guarantees were no longer reasonable from an actuarial standpoint. The DAV also recommended that this lower interest rate level remain in place until 2023, citing the lack of signs of a noticeable recovery in interest rates and the economic uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.",

The German actuarial associ- ation Deutsche Aktuarvereinigung (DAV) had called for this to happen numerous times, as extensive premium guarantees were no longer reasonable from an actuari- al standpoint due to the persistently low interest rates. In November last year, the DAV also recommended that this level remain in place until 2023: \u2018We do not current- ly see signs of a noticeable recovery in interest rates in the near future, not least in light of the economic uncer- tainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic\u2019, said Herbert Schneidemann, chairman of the DAV, to support the recommendation.\n\nFor this reason, more and more insurers are developing new products with different guarantee models, moving away from traditional policies with guaranteed interest in the process. In the financial year ended, some insur- ers even abandoned the 100 per cent premium guar- antee completely. They only offer a complete premium guarantee where they are required by law to do so.\n\nRegulatory matters were also high on the list of insurers\u2019 priorities in the financial year ended. Be it the Europe- an Transparency Directive, the revision of Solvency II or the introduction of new international financial reporting rules (IFRS 17), the implementation of statutory regula- tions has made it necessary to make extensive adjust- ments.

It reports that more than 60 per cent of insurers are currently working to mi- grate to cloud-based solutions.\n\nIn March 2021, the European Commission introduced the Transparency Directive (Sustainable Finance Dis- closure Regulation; SFDR) for financial service provid- ers. The directive governs the disclosure obligations of pro duct providers and financial advisors in terms of sustainability in strategies, processes and products. The regulatory requirements also apply to insurance brokers, life insurers and providers of company pension schemes. The Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) that expand on the directive are expected to apply from mid- 2022 onwards. This will increase the amount of regula- tory paperwork for life insurers and providers of compa- ny pension schemes.\n\nWith regard to old-age pensions, the German govern- ment has also decided to introduce a digital pension overview. It aims to provide customers with a quick over- view of their statutory, company and private pension en- titlements. The German Pension Overview Act (Rent\u00dcG) came into effect on 18 February 2021. The law requires all providers of private and company old-age pensions to connect to the portal if they are obliged to send regu- lar summaries to their customers while they are paying into the pension. After a 21-month development phase, the platform is set to go live in autumn 2023.\n\nFinally, the launch of a voluntary Pan-European Pen- sion Product (PEPP) has been decided on a European level. The regulatory technical standards were defined in March 2021. PEPP is to be available throughout Eu- rope, although providers will have to meet strict criteria before they are permitted to offer it. The European pen- sion is designed to be complementary to existing state, statutory and occupational pension systems. Potential providers of the pension include insurance companies, company pension funds, banks and administrators of alternative investment funds.\n\nDigitisation also remains at the top of the agenda for the German insurance industry. In particular, digitisa- tion has been accelerated greatly by the Covid-19 crisis. Digitised business processes enable the ever-greater integration of systems across divisions, segments and company boundaries. That makes it possible to exploit the potential represented by the standardisation and automation of processes to a greater extent.

Although insurers did have to accept larger drops in profits and premiums in some cases, the industry was in good over- all condition when it was hit by the crisis, enabling it to mostly remain profitable. Even the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) describes the European insurance industry as \u2018fundamentally ro- bust\u2019. This is demonstrated by the results of the stress test 2021 that were published in December 2021.

Such expertise manifests itself in the strategic development of employee know-how, as well as in the further de- velopment of software tools that give efficient support to the consulting activities. Needless to say, all R & D activities are subject to the imperative of sustainable cost-efficiency.\n\nThe msg life Group does not conduct open-ended re- search, but instead focuses on purely target-oriented research. Special importance is attached to close com- munication with the market and customers as their as- sessment of the products\u2019 relevance to business success is crucial. The msg life Group therefore attaches a great deal of importance to its cooperation with customers in the user and operator groups as well as with partners (IBM or the msg Group, for example) in relation to its most important products. The approaches devised with-\n\nin the framework of research are presented, discussed and evaluated within the user and operator groups at an early stage and, if required, on a cross-product basis. The evaluation is conducted with particular regard to users\u2019 interest in acquiring the product enhancements. In this way, new releases of standard software products are generally partially financed by advance orders from some of the customers.\n\nAs there are no user groups that can be accessed for the placement of new products or the opening up of new markets, early customer models are used which reward a customer\u2019s early decision in favour of a new product with commercial benefits.\n\nPurchasing R & D expertise\n\nIn its capacity as market leader in its core business, the msg life Group is usually unable to have recourse to ready-made external research findings. This particularly applies to specialist thematic areas in the customers\u2019 sectors. As a sector-specific service provider, the com-\n\nT N E M E G A N A M\n\n20\n\npany prefers to rely on its own research, which builds upon its participation in trade conferences, association activities and joint projects with partner companies. Fu- ture trends, too, can usually be identified more reliably on the basis of the systematic reviewing of customer requirements from projects and canvassing situations than on the basis of external surveys. It goes without saying that the qualification level of the Group\u2019s em- ployees is updated continuously by means of selective (also external) ongoing training activities. In the tech- nology sector, msg life makes use of rapidly develop- ing standards and non-proprietary technologies right\n\nthrough to freely available open-source products. The company also safeguards the quality of its own techno- logical orientation by maintaining close partnerships with IBM and with selected colleges and universities.\n\nR & D expenditure\n\nThe msg life Group\u2019s R & D expenditure totalled 11.195 million euros in the 2021 financial year (previous year: 8.934 million euros). Once again, no development ex- penses were capitalised.\n\nEmployees\n\nOn 31 December 2021, the msg life Group had 1,204 permanent employees including managing directors (31 December 2020: 1,172 permanent employees).\n\nwhich applicants are asked individual interview ques- tions in videos and are able to respond with their own recorded answers.\n\nFor the company, the 2021 financial year was again overshadowed by the restrictions on working in offices and on customers\u2019 premises due to the pandemic, as well as the extremely high percentage of employees who worked from home. As the company was able to master this decentralised way of working largely with- out issue in the second year of the pandemic, it has laid a robust cornerstone for the future of work organisation at msg life. The company took the various services it of- fers to support employees and their families further in 2021, and made further improvements to this field with a service provider and its extensive range of options and services."

            "context": "Equity amounts to 53.2 million euros (previous year: 42.4 million euros), which represents an increase of 10.8 million euros. The net loss decreased to 1.4 million euros (previous year: net loss of 12.2 million euros) due to the current net result for the year, which does not put the company in a position to distribute dividends.\n\nTotal assets as at 31 December 2021 amounted to 113.5 million euros (previous year: 97.2 million euros).\n\nT R O P E R\n\nT N E M E G A N A M P U O R G D N A\n\nT R O P E R\n\nt n e m p o e v e d d n a h c r a e s e R\n\nl\n\nResearch and development\n\nFocus of R & D activities\n\nFor msg life, research and development (R & D) serves not only to develop and expand standard software solu- tions, but also to extend its consulting expertise. Such expertise manifests itself in the strategic development of employee know-how, as well as in the further de- velopment of software tools that give efficient support to the consulting activities. Needless to say, all R & D activities are subject to the imperative of sustainable cost-efficiency.\n\nThe msg life Group does not conduct open-ended re- search, but instead focuses on purely target-oriented research. Special importance is attached to close com- munication with the market and customers as their as- sessment of the products\u2019 relevance to business success is crucial. The msg life Group therefore attaches a great deal of importance to its cooperation with customers in the user and operator groups as well as with partners (IBM or the msg Group, for example) in relation to its most important products. The approaches devised with-\n\nin the framework of research are presented, discussed and evaluated within the user and operator groups at an early stage and, if required, on a cross-product basis. The evaluation is conducted with particular regard to users\u2019 interest in acquiring the product enhancements. In this way, new releases of standard software products are generally partially financed by advance orders from some of the customers.\n\nAs there are no user groups that can be accessed for the placement of new products or the opening up of new markets, early customer models are used which reward a customer\u2019s early decision in favour of a new product with commercial benefits.\n\nPurchasing R & D expertise\n\nIn its capacity as market leader in its core business, the msg life Group is usually unable to have recourse to ready-made external research findings. This particularly applies to specialist thematic areas in the customers\u2019 sectors. As a sector-specific service provider, the com-\n\nT N E M E G A N A M\n\n20\n\npany prefers to rely on its own research, which builds upon its participation in trade conferences, association activities and joint projects with partner companies. Fu- ture trends, too, can usually be identified more reliably on the basis of the systematic reviewing of customer requirements from projects and canvassing situations than on the basis of external surveys. It goes without saying that the qualification level of the Group\u2019s em- ployees is updated continuously by means of selective (also external) ongoing training activities. In the tech- nology sector, msg life makes use of rapidly develop- ing standards and non-proprietary technologies right\n\nthrough to freely available open-source products. The company also safeguards the quality of its own techno- logical orientation by maintaining close partnerships with IBM and with selected colleges and universities.\n\nR & D expenditure\n\nThe msg life Group\u2019s R & D expenditure totalled 11.195 million euros in the 2021 financial year (previous year: 8.934 million euros). Once again, no development ex- penses were capitalised.\n\nEmployees\n\nOn 31 December 2021, the msg life Group had 1,204 permanent employees including managing directors (31 December 2020: 1,172 permanent employees).\n\nwhich applicants are asked individual interview ques- tions in videos and are able to respond with their own recorded answers.\n\nFor the company, the 2021 financial year was again overshadowed by the restrictions on working in offices and on customers\u2019 premises due to the pandemic, as well as the extremely high percentage of employees who worked from home. As the company was able to master this decentralised way of working largely with- out issue in the second year of the pandemic, it has laid a robust cornerstone for the future of work organisation at msg life. The company took the various services it of- fers to support employees and their families further in 2021, and made further improvements to this field with a service provider and its extensive range of options and services."

After the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act suffered from a lack of support from the Trump administration, the Biden administra- tion pressed on with an improvement to the Patient Pro- tection and Affordable Care Act in late 2021 in the form of the Build Back Better Act. As a result, state healthcare programmes such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid can be expected to grow further.

Consequently, as described in detail in the \u2018Research\n\nmsg life\n\nrethinking insurance\n\nAnnual Report 2021\n\n23\n\nand development\u2019 chapter within this condensed man- agement report and Group management report, the rel- evant R & D activities at msg life serve, firstly, the further development and enhancement of standard software solutions, and secondly, the expansion of available ex- pertise on consulting topics.\n\nnone of these risks arose and, for this reason \u2013 and also because of the steps taken by msg life and the perfor- mance of its project business in the current financial year 2022 \u2013 the company still sees no significant effects on its operating and financial performance as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic at the time these financial state- ments were prepared.\n\nProduct- and service-specific opportunities\n\nIn addition, msg life\u2019s employees are crucial to the company\u2019s innovative power and the customers\u2019 value added \u2013 and are therefore instrumental in the growth and profitability of the msg life Group as a whole. More information about the future opportunities being gener- ated by msg life\u2019s employees can be found in the \u2018Em- ployees\u2019 chapter within this condensed management report and Group management report.\n\nLike all software products, the msg life Group\u2019s pro- ducts can have defects whose elimination under guar- antee increases costs and thereby influences the profit margin or even leads to compensation claims against the msg life Group. The msg life companies generally assume the warranty which is customary in the indus- try. As far as possible, liability obligations are limited contractually to the legal minimum and are secured with appropriate liability insurance policies. It can neverthe- less not be entirely ruled out that contractually agreed limitations on liability will be regarded as invalid and the existing insurance cover will be available to an in- sufficient extent or not at all \u2013 even if this is improbable.\n\nRisk assessment\n\nThe following risks are listed in descending order based on their estimated probability of occurrence and im- pacts. Additionally, unless indicated otherwise, the following disclosures concern all the fields of business.\n\nProject and product risks\n\nThe main potential source of risk in the course of op- erating activity lies in the calculation of the complex projects and in their organisational, functional, techni- cal and commercial handling. These risks are controlled and monitored by means of the valid Group-wide stan- dards for project and project risk management. The risk nevertheless remains that projects cannot be realised profitably for the msg life Group because costs exceed the agreed budget, deadlines cannot be met or the ser- vices rendered fail to comply with the agreed functional specifications or the required quality, and the msg life Group will therefore have to grant a discount or pay com- pensation. The overall risk profile of all ongoing projects was further reduced in 2021. The existing risks of indi- vidual projects have been appropriately taken into ac- count for 2022. The cumulative occurrence in multiple projects could, however, lead to negative effects."

        "answer": "The main potential source of risk in the course of operating activity for the msg life Group lies in the calculation of complex projects and in their organisational, functional, technical, and commercial handling. These risks are controlled and monitored by means of the valid Group-wide standards for project and project risk management. However, there is still a risk that projects cannot be realized profitably because costs exceed the agreed budget, deadlines cannot be met, or the services rendered fail to comply with the agreed functional specifications or required quality. In such cases, the msg life Group may have to grant a discount or pay compensation. The overall risk profile of all ongoing projects was further reduced in 2021, and the existing risks of individual projects have been appropriately taken into account for 2022. However, the cumulative occurrence of risks in multiple projects could lead to negative effects.",

            "context": "In the past, the Group company FJA-US, Inc. profited from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) which was enacted in 2013 in terms of both turnover and earnings. After the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act suffered from a lack of support from the Trump administration, the Biden administra- tion pressed on with an improvement to the Patient Pro- tection and Affordable Care Act in late 2021 in the form of the Build Back Better Act. As a result, state healthcare programmes such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid can be expected to grow further. Thanks to its now well-established partnerships with leading providers such as Companion Data Services, the msg life Group company in the USA can offer end-to-end ser- vices including claims handling. Additionally, the com- pany successfully expanded its related activities in the health and group insurance market and further diversi- fied its range of services.\n\nOpportunities from regulatory developments\n\nIn accordance with the current version of the guideline, monthly reports were prepared on the most significant risks and the operative and central divisional managers and employees with special positions in terms of risks were surveyed three times per year. The Risk Board met three times in 2021. At the same time, data protection, the company\u2019s internal auditing, IT security and com-\n\nRegulatory adjustments as a result of legislative amend- ments are generating additional demand for consulting services and new or modified products among existing customers and, if integrated quickly into the products on offer, can constitute a crucial competitive advantage. Consequently, as described in detail in the \u2018Research\n\nmsg life\n\nrethinking insurance\n\nAnnual Report 2021\n\n23\n\nand development\u2019 chapter within this condensed man- agement report and Group management report, the rel- evant R & D activities at msg life serve, firstly, the further development and enhancement of standard software solutions, and secondly, the expansion of available ex- pertise on consulting topics.\n\nnone of these risks arose and, for this reason \u2013 and also because of the steps taken by msg life and the perfor- mance of its project business in the current financial year 2022 \u2013 the company still sees no significant effects on its operating and financial performance as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic at the time these financial state- ments were prepared.\n\nProduct- and service-specific opportunities\n\nIn addition, msg life\u2019s employees are crucial to the company\u2019s innovative power and the customers\u2019 value added \u2013 and are therefore instrumental in the growth and profitability of the msg life Group as a whole. More information about the future opportunities being gener- ated by msg life\u2019s employees can be found in the \u2018Em- ployees\u2019 chapter within this condensed management report and Group management report.\n\nLike all software products, the msg life Group\u2019s pro- ducts can have defects whose elimination under guar- antee increases costs and thereby influences the profit margin or even leads to compensation claims against the msg life Group. The msg life companies generally assume the warranty which is customary in the indus- try. As far as possible, liability obligations are limited contractually to the legal minimum and are secured with appropriate liability insurance policies. It can neverthe- less not be entirely ruled out that contractually agreed limitations on liability will be regarded as invalid and the existing insurance cover will be available to an in- sufficient extent or not at all \u2013 even if this is improbable.\n\nRisk assessment\n\nThe following risks are listed in descending order based on their estimated probability of occurrence and im- pacts. Additionally, unless indicated otherwise, the following disclosures concern all the fields of business.\n\nProject and product risks\n\nThe main potential source of risk in the course of op- erating activity lies in the calculation of the complex projects and in their organisational, functional, techni- cal and commercial handling. These risks are controlled and monitored by means of the valid Group-wide stan- dards for project and project risk management. The risk nevertheless remains that projects cannot be realised profitably for the msg life Group because costs exceed the agreed budget, deadlines cannot be met or the ser- vices rendered fail to comply with the agreed functional specifications or the required quality, and the msg life Group will therefore have to grant a discount or pay com- pensation. The overall risk profile of all ongoing projects was further reduced in 2021. The existing risks of indi- vidual projects have been appropriately taken into ac- count for 2022. The cumulative occurrence in multiple projects could, however, lead to negative effects."

        "question": "What risks does msg life face in the 2021 financial year?",
        "answer": "In the 2021 financial year, msg life faces several risks. One of the main risks is the potential impact of the current Covid-19 pandemic on the company. To mitigate this risk, the company has taken comprehensive action by providing employees with the necessary hardware and software to work remotely from home. However, there is still a risk that employees may fall ill and be unable to work on customer projects, or that customers may be unable to perform necessary supporting services, which could result in delays or negative impacts on the company's economic development. Another risk is the use of third-party software in msg life's own software products, which can contain defects that may affect the functionality of the company's products. Problems in project execution and software defects can also damage the company's reputation. Additionally, msg life faces personnel risks, as its success depends on the skills, qualifications, and motivation of its employees. If the company is unable to retain key employees or recruit qualified and skilled employees, it may suffer adverse effects. The company also faces economic risks, as the general economic trend can affect customer behavior and investment in IT infrastructure and management consulting. An economic downturn could reduce the market volume on which msg life focuses, leading to restructuring costs and delays in planned cost reductions.",

In this way, it hopes to achieve a decisive competitive advantage on the market, particularly vis-\u00e0-vis new competitors with aggressive pricing policies.\n\nmsg life is currently interested in expanding its market position in German-speaking countries and internation- ally, primarily through organic growth. This can also be supported in parallel by strategic acquisitions.

Adequate valuation al- lowances have been made to cover the estimated de- fault risk. As the credit rating of clients in the insurance industry is generally good, the receivables are not in- sured. The maximum default risk is in principle equiva- lent to the nominal values less the valuation allowances. There is no other loan collateral and there are no other risk-mitigating agreements (such as guarantees, land charges or pledges) in place. Usage reservations exist until payment is complete. For invoiced receivables, the net balance of additions to and reversals of valuation allowances was 819,000 euros (previous year: 14,000 euros). On each effective date, trade receivables do not include any carrying amounts for which terms have been renegotiated and which would otherwise be over- due.\n\nWith regard to the analysis of trade receivables which are overdue but not impaired as at the end of the report- ing period, the reader is referred to section IV \u2018Notes on the statement of financial position\u2019, number 3 \u2018Trade receivables\u2019 in the notes.\n\nT R O P E R\n\nT N E M E G A N A M P U O R G D N A\n\nT R O P E R\n\nt r o p e r k s i r d n a y t i n u t r o p p O\n\nThe potential risks to the msg life Group associated with financial instruments consist notably of liquidity risks \u2013 which can result in a company being unable to raise the funds needed to settle its financial liabilities \u2013 currency risks resulting from its activities in various currency ar- eas, default risks arising from the non-fulfilment of con- tractual obligations by contracting parties and interest rate risks caused by movements in the market interest rate leading to a change in the fair value of a financial instrument and interest-related cash flow risks, which lead to a change in the future cash flows of a financial instrument due to changes in market interest rates.\n\nOrganisation:\n\nThe company has organised its risk management pro- cess along clear, functional lines.

The ongoing trend towards internationalisation and consolidation is an- other factor and, given the efforts to reduce costs and increase efficiency within insurance companies, there is a clear correlation between modern and flexible IT on the one hand and corporate success on the other.\n\nT R O P E R\n\nT N E M E G A N A M P U O R G D N A\n\nT R O P E R\n\nT N E M E G A N A M\n\nt s a c e r o F\n\n28\n\nDespite persistently difficult general conditions, private life insurance cover remains indispensable in Germany in view of the demographic trend and the necessity of covering against biometric risks. In the process, almost all insurers are striving to enhance their existing pro- duct ranges and develop new, innovative ones \u2013 this goes for all existing product groups, control layers and legal forms. The companies\u2019 starting situations and the pressure on them to innovate vary and are consequent- ly bringing about a variety of innovations. The focus is on products that tick more than one box at the same time: products that satisfy the desire of the policyhold- ers for security, returns and flexibility, meet the needs of the insurer in terms of more efficiency and profitabil- ity and comply with the regulatory requirements at the same time.\n\nIn terms of the conventional capital accumulation pro- ducts, modifications of the guarantees are dominant, for example through the use of current calculation guidelines or by dispensing with the annual interest guarantee. With the biometric products, too, there is a great deal of action on the market. Dynamic hybrid products have become the standard now and there is a continuous flow of innovative products in addition to them which allow, for example, investment in funds, but also the purchasing of options on the basis of tra- ditional basic cover. Insurance companies at the larger end of the scale in particular are offering products for old-age provision with capital guarantees on the basis of unit-linked approaches with investment guarantees.\n\nGiven the current challenges, microservice-oriented ar- chitectures designed to quickly support modified busi- ness models and high system versatility for the rapid in- troduction of innovative products are factors crucial to the success of insurance companies. The developments in insurance products described above are typically not associated with particular product families. The plat- form economy is also playing a key role in the insurance industry this year: numerous insurers are now using platforms and ecosystems to provide digital products and services beyond what had previously been their core business \u2013 this in turn is opening up new ways to create value.\n\nFor larger insurance companies, the acquisition of closed insurance contract portfolios that are no lon- ger available for sale (\u2018run-off\u2019 portfolios) from mainly smaller insurance companies remains an important fac- tor. This enables the latter to generate positive effects for their books, and buyers can generate significant economies of scale and cost synergies. Modern asset management with modern and powerful IT systems plays a decisive role in this regard as well in the more efficient management of contracts.\n\nThe digitisation of our economy and society has been accelerated greatly by the Covid-19 pandemic and re- mains one of the most significant challenges facing the German insurance industry. Digitised business pro- cesses enable the ever-greater integration of systems across divisions, segments and company boundaries. That makes it possible to exploit the potential repre- sented by the standardisation and automation of pro- cesses to a greater extent. Fully automated processes lead to enormous gains with regard to efficiency as well as significantly lower costs. The subjects of customer centricity and individualisation, industrialisation and automation, analytics and data effectiveness, and stan- dardisation and integration are at the heart of the digi- tisation trend. Insurers are increasingly committed to cloud solutions with which IT capacities can be adapted to meet the level of demand in a flexible manner.\n\nWith digitisation, modern insurance products and ser- vices can be made available on new channels or inte- grated into new sales and cooperation platforms; all of this requires extensive changes to the IT landscapes of insurers in order for the new technology and platforms to be integrated and is taken into account by msg life when it develops its products and services. The compa- ny already has SaaS and cloud-based solutions to sup- port its customers with the digitisation process, thanks in no small part to its strategic collaboration with IBM.\n\nIn light of these developments, msg life anticipates that insurance companies will show a general interest in the software and consulting solutions it will be offering in 2022."

This leads to increased efficiency, lower costs, and the ability to exploit the potential of customer centricity, individualisation, industrialisation, automation, analytics, data effectiveness, and standardisation. Insurers are increasingly adopting cloud solutions to adapt IT capacities flexibly to meet demand.",

            "context": "Consequently, the German-speaking market will remain very challenging for all insurance companies this year and probably in the years to come. The ongoing trend towards internationalisation and consolidation is an- other factor and, given the efforts to reduce costs and increase efficiency within insurance companies, there is a clear correlation between modern and flexible IT on the one hand and corporate success on the other.\n\nT R O P E R\n\nT N E M E G A N A M P U O R G D N A\n\nT R O P E R\n\nT N E M E G A N A M\n\nt s a c e r o F\n\n28\n\nDespite persistently difficult general conditions, private life insurance cover remains indispensable in Germany in view of the demographic trend and the necessity of covering against biometric risks. In the process, almost all insurers are striving to enhance their existing pro- duct ranges and develop new, innovative ones \u2013 this goes for all existing product groups, control layers and legal forms. The companies\u2019 starting situations and the pressure on them to innovate vary and are consequent- ly bringing about a variety of innovations. The focus is on products that tick more than one box at the same time: products that satisfy the desire of the policyhold- ers for security, returns and flexibility, meet the needs of the insurer in terms of more efficiency and profitabil- ity and comply with the regulatory requirements at the same time.\n\nIn terms of the conventional capital accumulation pro- ducts, modifications of the guarantees are dominant, for example through the use of current calculation guidelines or by dispensing with the annual interest guarantee. With the biometric products, too, there is a great deal of action on the market. Dynamic hybrid products have become the standard now and there is a continuous flow of innovative products in addition to them which allow, for example, investment in funds, but also the purchasing of options on the basis of tra- ditional basic cover. Insurance companies at the larger end of the scale in particular are offering products for old-age provision with capital guarantees on the basis of unit-linked approaches with investment guarantees.\n\nGiven the current challenges, microservice-oriented ar- chitectures designed to quickly support modified busi- ness models and high system versatility for the rapid in- troduction of innovative products are factors crucial to the success of insurance companies. The developments in insurance products described above are typically not associated with particular product families. The plat- form economy is also playing a key role in the insurance industry this year: numerous insurers are now using platforms and ecosystems to provide digital products and services beyond what had previously been their core business \u2013 this in turn is opening up new ways to create value.\n\nFor larger insurance companies, the acquisition of closed insurance contract portfolios that are no lon- ger available for sale (\u2018run-off\u2019 portfolios) from mainly smaller insurance companies remains an important fac- tor. This enables the latter to generate positive effects for their books, and buyers can generate significant economies of scale and cost synergies. Modern asset management with modern and powerful IT systems plays a decisive role in this regard as well in the more efficient management of contracts.\n\nThe digitisation of our economy and society has been accelerated greatly by the Covid-19 pandemic and re- mains one of the most significant challenges facing the German insurance industry. Digitised business pro- cesses enable the ever-greater integration of systems across divisions, segments and company boundaries. That makes it possible to exploit the potential repre- sented by the standardisation and automation of pro- cesses to a greater extent. Fully automated processes lead to enormous gains with regard to efficiency as well as significantly lower costs. The subjects of customer centricity and individualisation, industrialisation and automation, analytics and data effectiveness, and stan- dardisation and integration are at the heart of the digi- tisation trend. Insurers are increasingly committed to cloud solutions with which IT capacities can be adapted to meet the level of demand in a flexible manner.\n\nWith digitisation, modern insurance products and ser- vices can be made available on new channels or inte- grated into new sales and cooperation platforms; all of this requires extensive changes to the IT landscapes of insurers in order for the new technology and platforms to be integrated and is taken into account by msg life when it develops its products and services. The compa- ny already has SaaS and cloud-based solutions to sup- port its customers with the digitisation process, thanks in no small part to its strategic collaboration with IBM.\n\nIn light of these developments, msg life anticipates that insurance companies will show a general interest in the software and consulting solutions it will be offering in 2022."

The useful lives are between three and ten years. Depreciable movable fixed assets that can be used independently and whose (net) costs per indi- vidual item exceed 250 euros, but not 800 euros, qualify as low-value assets and are immediately recognised as expenses in the year of acquisition.\n\nAssets with a cost of less than 250 euros are recognised as expenses.\n\nInventories are measured at historical cost. Apart from the unit costs, the costs of production also include an appropriate proportion of the overhead costs and write- downs. The loss-free valuation rule is observed. Work contracts which extend across multiple financial years are treated as work in progress until the milestone is deliv- ered, fully or in part, to the customer. Advance payments received on account of or- ders are written off openly from inventories.\n\nAccounts receivable and other assets are valued at their face value as a matter of prin- ciple. Receivables with terms exceeding one year are deducted. A lump-sum valuation adjustment amounting to 0.5% of the net accounts receivable is established for the general credit risk and to cover loss of interest, provided that no payments on account have been made.\n\nMarketable securities are recognised at the lower of historical cost or fair value on the reporting date.\n\nCash in hand, bank balances and cheques are recognised at their nominal amount.\n\nForeign currency transactions are converted by Group companies on the date on which the transaction is first recognised at the mean spot exchange rate applicable in the month of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in a foreign currency are converted at every reporting date in accordance with section 256a, sentence 2, of the HGB, using the mean spot exchange rate on the relevant reporting date. Differences arising from the settlement or conversion of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nT N E M E T A T S\n\nL A\n\nI\n\nC N A N\n\nI F\n\nD E T A D\n\nI L O S N O C\n\ns e t o N\n\ns d o h t e m n o i t a u l a v d n a g n i t n u o c c a l a r e n e G\n\n40\n\nThe asset and liability items of foreign business operations (with the exception of equity) are converted into euros within the scope of consolidation at the mean spot exchange rate on the respective reporting date in accordance with section 308a of the HGB.

The useful lives are between three and ten years. Depreciable movable fixed assets that can be used independently and whose (net) costs per indi- vidual item exceed 250 euros, but not 800 euros, qualify as low-value assets and are immediately recognised as expenses in the year of acquisition.\n\nAssets with a cost of less than 250 euros are recognised as expenses.\n\nInventories are measured at historical cost. Apart from the unit costs, the costs of production also include an appropriate proportion of the overhead costs and write- downs. The loss-free valuation rule is observed. Work contracts which extend across multiple financial years are treated as work in progress until the milestone is deliv- ered, fully or in part, to the customer. Advance payments received on account of or- ders are written off openly from inventories.\n\nAccounts receivable and other assets are valued at their face value as a matter of prin- ciple. Receivables with terms exceeding one year are deducted. A lump-sum valuation adjustment amounting to 0.5% of the net accounts receivable is established for the general credit risk and to cover loss of interest, provided that no payments on account have been made.\n\nMarketable securities are recognised at the lower of historical cost or fair value on the reporting date.\n\nCash in hand, bank balances and cheques are recognised at their nominal amount.\n\nForeign currency transactions are converted by Group companies on the date on which the transaction is first recognised at the mean spot exchange rate applicable in the month of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in a foreign currency are converted at every reporting date in accordance with section 256a, sentence 2, of the HGB, using the mean spot exchange rate on the relevant reporting date.

Events after the reporting period\n\nWith regard to the ongoing global Covid-19 pandemic, msg life still sees no significant impacts on the operational or economic development of the company, including in light of the steps taken by msg life and the development of its business with new and existing customers and projects in the 2022 financial year so far.\n\nIn February of this year, after the end of the reporting period, Russia invaded Ukraine and economic sanctions were imposed on Russia as a result. It is impossible to judge the effects of this crisis on the course of business of the msg life Group in 2022. At the time of preparation of the annual financial statements, however, msg life does not expect any significant changes to its economic or operational development.\n\nWith regard to both of these topics, we also refer to the corresponding statements in the opportunity and risk report of the condensed management and Group manage- ment report for the 2021 financial year.\n\nThere were no further events after the reporting date.\n\nLeinfelden-Echterdingen, 14 April 2022\n\nROLF ZIELKE Chairman of the Management Board\n\nFRANCESCO CARGNEL Member of the Management Board\n\nROBERT HESS Member of the Management Board\n\nMILENKO RADIC Member of the Management Board\n\nDR WOLF WIEDMANN Member of the Management Board\n\nT N E M E T A T S\n\nL A\n\nI\n\nC N A N\n\nI F\n\ns e t o N\n\nD E T A D\n\nI L O S N O C\n\n60\n\nConsolidated statement of changes in fixed assets for the period\n\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nfrom 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021\n\nFixed assets 2021\n\nHistorical costs of acquisition and production\n\nAccumulated depreciation/amortisation Net carrying amounts\n\nAs at 1 January 2021\n\nAdditions\n\nReclassifi- cations\n\nDisposals\n\nDisposals in the con- solidation group\n\nForeign currency differences\n\nAs at 31 December 2021\n\nAs at\n\n1 January\n\n2021\n\nAdditions\n\nDisposals\n\nDisposals\n\nin the con-\n\nsolidation\n\ngroup\n\nForeign\n\ncurrency\n\ndifferences\n\nAs at 31\n\nDecember\n\n2021\n\nAs at\n\n1 January\n\n2021\n\nAs at 31\n\nDecember\n\n2021\n\nThousand euros\n\nThousand euros\n\nThousand euros\n\nThousand euros\n\nThousand euros\n\nThousand euros\n\nThousand euros\n\nThousand\n\neuros\n\nThousand\n\neuros\n\nThousand\n\neuros\n\nThousand\n\neuros\n\nThousand\n\neuros\n\nThousand\n\neuros\n\nThousand\n\neuros\n\nThousand\n\neuros\n\nI.\n\nIntangible assets\n\n1.
