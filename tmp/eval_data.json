        "answer": "The company faces risks related to interest rates and currency exchange rates. Interest rate risks refer to fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments due to changes in market interest rates. The company's trade receivables do not have significant concentration on individual customers, but the ten largest customers accounted for a significant share of turnover. As for currency risks, they arise from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments due to changes in exchange rates. However, the company believes that these risks do not pose a threat to its continued existence and is confident in its ability to successfully manage them.",
