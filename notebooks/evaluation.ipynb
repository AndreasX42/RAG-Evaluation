      "What risks does msg life face?\n",
      "msg life faces several risks, including economic risks related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and resulting economic sanctions, IT security risks, risks from takeovers and competition, and liquidity risks. The economic risks are difficult to judge in terms of their impact on msg life's business in 2022, but the company does not expect significant changes. To address IT security risks, msg life takes extensive technical and organizational measures such as restrictive authorization and access controls, regular backups, and penetration tests. In terms of competition risks, msg life aims to maintain its existing strategy and achieve a competitive advantage by covering entire value chains and product ranges. The company is also interested in expanding its market position through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Liquidity risk management involves ensuring sufficient liquid funds or credit lines to meet payment obligations and hedge against payment flow fluctuations. Finally, msg life faces credit risks arising from deteriorating economic circumstances of debtors or counterparties, which can result in default on payments or a reduction in the value of financial instruments.\n",

This includes interest and redemption payments. The group manages liquidity risk by monitoring daily cash holdings and monthly financial plans. The goal is to finance predictable deficits at standard market terms and avoid borrowing capital at excessive interest rates or investing surplus funds at below-market interest rates.
