The currency risk on the asset side in relation to trade receivables comes from receivables not denominated in euros, accounting for 15 per cent (previous year: 13 per cent). In the case of trade payables, currency risks occur in relation to the 3 per cent of liabilities not denominated in euros (previ- ous year: 5 per cent). Differences arising from currency conversion of financial statements from a foreign cur- rency to the Group currency for the creation of consol- idated financial statements do not affect currency risk because the respective changes in foreign currency are recognised under equity with no effect on income.\n\nInformation on risk concentration (concentration risks):"

The use of AI, particularly automated machine learning, improves efficiency through automation and enables new technical approaches. This, in turn, paves the way for new business models, services, and products. Insurers are focusing on robo-advisers, advanced analytics, and blockchain in connection with AI. For example, msg life is developing deep neural networks (DNNs) for the actuarial computation module in cooperation with the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. These DNNs will allow life insurers to replace old system generations, integrate artificial intelligence into their core functions, and modernize their systems. Larger insurance companies also acquire closed insurance contract portfolios from smaller companies, known as 'run-off' portfolios, to generate positive effects for their books and achieve economies of scale and cost synergies. Modern asset management with powerful IT systems is crucial for efficient contract management in this regard.",

It is impossible to judge the effects of this crisis on the course of business of the msg life Group in 2022. At the time of preparation of the annual financial statements, however, msg life does not expect any significant changes to its economic or operational development.\n\nWith regard to both of these topics, we also refer to the corresponding statements in the opportunity and risk report of the condensed management and Group manage- ment report for the 2021 financial year.\n\nThere were no further events after the reporting date.\n\nLeinfelden-Echterdingen, 14 April 2022\n\nROLF ZIELKE Chairman of the Management Board\n\nFRANCESCO CARGNEL Member of the Management Board"

If a material uncertainty exists, the auditor is required to draw attention to the related disclosures in the financial statements and modify their opinions if the disclosures are inadequate. The auditor's conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report, but future events or conditions may impact the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.",

Fixed assets\n\nThe development of fixed assets in the financial year and in the previous year, in- cluding their breakdown, is presented separately in the consolidated statement of changes in fixed assets (see Appendix to the notes).\n\nThe intangible assets are essentially software purchased from third parties.\n\nIntangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over an expected useful life. The expected useful life of software purchased from third parties is between three and 15 years.\n\nThe disposal in the financial assets concerns an interest in ARGE FJA KR BU-System, Munich, which has not been consolidated. The msg life Group had few means of par- ticipating in the financial and business decision-making processes of the company and as such has no significant influence over the company.\n\n2.\n\nInventories"

Both the World Bank and the IMF expect growth of 3.2 per cent in 2023. These predictions take into account factors such as the Covid-19 situation, supply bottlenecks, and the high rate of inflation.",

The IMF expects the global economy to grow by just 4.4 per cent this year, following growth of 5.9 per cent last year \u2013 0.5 per cent less than initially forecast.
