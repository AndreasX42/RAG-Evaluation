        "answer": "From the moment that the French defenses at Sedan and on the Meuse were broken, a rapid retreat to Amiens and the south could have saved the British and French Armies. However, the French High Command hoped to close the gap and keep holding the right hand of the Belgians. The German eruption swept around the right and rear of the Armies of the north, cutting off all communications and severing supply lines. Boulogne and Calais were scenes of desperate fighting, but the armored scythe-stroke almost reached Dunkirk.",

The French High Command hoped they would be able to\n\nclose the gap, and the Armies of the north were under their orders. Moreover, a\n\nretirement of this kind would have involved almost certainly the destruction of\n\nthe fine Belgian Army of over 20 divisions and the abandonment of the whole of\n\nBelgium. Therefore, when the force and scope of the German penetration were\n\nrealized and when a new French Generalissimo, General Weygand, assumed command\n\nin place of General Gamelin, an effort was made by the French and British\n\nArmies in Belgium to keep on holding the right hand of the Belgians and to give\n\ntheir own right hand to a newly created French Army which was to have advanced\n\nacross the Somme in great strength to grasp it.\n\n\n\nHowever, the German\n\neruption swept like a sharp scythe around the right and rear of the Armies of\n\nthe north. Eight or nine armored divisions, each of about four hundred armored\n\nvehicles of different kinds, but carefully assorted to be complementary and\n\ndivisible into small self-contained units, cut off all communications between\n\nus and the main French Armies. It severed our own communications for food and\n\nammunition, which ran first to Amiens and afterwards through Abbeville, and it\n\nshore its way up the coast to Boulogne and Calais, and almost to Dunkirk.\n\nBehind this armored and mechanized onslaught came a number of German divisions\n\nin lorries, and behind them again there plodded comparatively slowly the dull\n\nbrute mass of the ordinary German Army and German people, always so ready to be\n\nled to the trampling down in other lands of liberties and comforts which they\n\nhave never known in their own.\n\n\n\nI have said this armored scythe-stroke\n\nalmost reached Dunkirk-almost but not quite. Boulogne and Calais were the\n\nscenes of desperate fighting. The Guards defended Boulogne for a while and were\n\nthen withdrawn by orders from this country. The Rifle Brigade, the 60th Rifles,"

        "answer": "The defense of Calais was a memorable resistance where about four thousand soldiers, including the Queen Victoria's Rifles, British tanks, and 1,000 Frenchmen, defended the city to the last. Despite being outnumbered, they fought for four days of intense street fighting before silence reigned over Calais. Only 30 unwounded survivors were brought off by the Navy, and the fate of their comrades is unknown. Their sacrifice, however, was not in vain as their resistance forced at least two armored divisions, which would have been turned against the British Expeditionary Force, to be sent to overcome them. This delay also allowed the French troops to flood and hold the Graveline water lines, keeping the port of Dunkirk open.",

Only 30 unwounded survivors\n\nwere brought off by the Navy, and we do not know the fate of their comrades.\n\nTheir sacrifice, however, was not in vain. At least two armored divisions,\n\nwhich otherwise would have been turned against the British Expeditionary Force,\n\nhad to be sent to overcome them.

When it was found impossible for the Armies of\n\nthe north to reopen their communications to Amiens with the main French Armies,\n\nonly one choice remained. It seemed, indeed, forlorn.

Had not\n\nthis Ruler and his Government severed themselves from the Allies, who rescued\n\ntheir country from extinction in the late war, and had they not sought refuge\n\nin what was proved to be a fatal neutrality, the French and British Armies\n\nmight well at the outset have saved not only Belgium but perhaps even Poland.\n\nYet at the last moment, when Belgium was already invaded, King Leopold called\n\nupon us to come to his aid, and even at the last moment we came. He and his\n\nbrave, efficient Army, nearly half a million strong, guarded our left flank and\n\nthus kept open our only line of retreat to the sea. Suddenly, without prior\n\nconsultation, with the least possible notice, without the advice of his\n\nMinisters and upon his own personal act, he sent a plenipotentiary to the\n\nGerman Command, surrendered his Army, and exposed our whole flank and means of\n\nretreat.\n\n\n\nI asked the House a week ago to suspend its judgment because\n\nthe facts were not clear, but I do not feel that any reason now exists why we\n\nshould not form our own opinions upon this pitiful episode.

Their U-boats, one\n\nof which was sunk, and their motor launches took their toll of the vast traffic\n\nwhich now began. For four or five days an intense struggle reigned.

        "answer": "From the moment that the French defenses at Sedan and on the Meuse were broken, a rapid retreat to Amiens and the south could have saved the British and French Armies. However, the French High Command initially hoped to close the gap and did not immediately realize the need for a retreat. When the force and scope of the German penetration were realized, a new French Generalissimo, General Weygand, assumed command and an effort was made to hold the right hand of the Belgians and give their own right hand to a newly created French Army.",

            "context": "From the moment that the French defenses at Sedan and on the Meuse were broken at the end of the second week of May, only a rapid retreat to Amiens and the south could have saved the British and French Armies who had entered Belgium at the appeal of the Belgian King; but this strategic fact was not immediately realized. The French High Command hoped they would be able to close the gap, and the Armies of the north were under their orders. Moreover, a retirement of this kind would have involved almost certainly the destruction of the fine Belgian Army of over 20 divisions and the abandonment of the whole of Belgium. Therefore, when the force and scope of the German penetration were realized and when a new French Generalissimo, General Weygand, assumed command in place of General Gamelin, an effort was made by the French and British Armies in Belgium to keep on holding the right hand of the Belgians and to give their own right hand to a newly created French Army which was to have advanced across the Somme in great strength to grasp it.\n\nHowever, the German eruption swept like a sharp scythe around the right and rear of the Armies of the north. Eight or nine armored divisions, each of about four hundred armored vehicles of different kinds, but carefully assorted to be complementary and divisible into small self-contained units, cut off all communications between us and the main French Armies. It severed our own communications for food and ammunition, which ran first to Amiens and afterwards through Abbeville, and it shore its way up the coast to Boulogne and Calais, and almost to Dunkirk. Behind this armored and mechanized onslaught came a number of German divisions in lorries, and behind them again there plodded comparatively slowly the dull brute mass of the ordinary German Army and German people, always so ready to be led to the trampling down in other lands of liberties and comforts which they have never known in their own."

        "question": "What was the significance of the defense of Boulogne and Calais?",
        "answer": "The defense of Boulogne and Calais was significant because it forced at least two armored divisions, which would have otherwise been used against the British Expeditionary Force, to be diverted to overcome the defenders. This diversion of resources bought valuable time for the Allies and allowed the port of Dunkirk to remain open, providing a crucial evacuation route for the surrounded Belgian, British, and French Armies.",

The Guards defended Boulogne for a while and were then withdrawn by orders from this country. The Rifle Brigade, the 60th Rifles, and the Queen Victoria\u2019s Rifles, with a battalion of British tanks and 1,000 Frenchmen, in all about four thousand strong, defended Calais to the last. The British Brigadier was given an hour to surrender. He spurned the offer, and four days of intense street fighting passed before silence reigned over Calais, which marked the end of a memorable resistance. Only 30 unwounded survivors were brought off by the Navy, and we do not know the fate of their comrades. Their sacrifice, however, was not in vain. At least two armored divisions, which otherwise would have been turned against the British Expeditionary Force, had to be sent to overcome them. They have added another page to the glories of the light divisions, and the time gained enabled the Graveline water lines to be flooded and to be held by the French troops.\n\nThus it was that the port of Dunkirk was kept open. When it was found impossible for the Armies of the north to reopen their communications to Amiens with the main French Armies, only one choice remained. It seemed, indeed, forlorn. The Belgian, British and\n\nFrench Armies were almost surrounded. Their sole line of retreat was to a single port and to its neighboring beaches. They were pressed on every side by heavy attacks and far outnumbered in the air."

I thought-and some good judges agreed with me-that perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 men might be re-embarked. But it certainly seemed that the whole of the French First Army and the whole of the British Expeditionary Force north of the Amiens-Abbeville gap would be broken up in the open field or else would have to capitulate for lack of food and ammunition. These were the hard and heavy tidings for which I called upon the House and the nation to prepare themselves a week ago. The whole root and core and brain of the British Army, on which and around which we were to build, and are to build, the great British Armies in the later years of the war, seemed about to perish upon the field or to be led into an ignominious and starving captivity.\n\nThat was the prospect a week ago. But another blow which might well have proved final was yet to fall upon us. The King of the Belgians had called upon us to come to his aid. Had not this Ruler and his Government severed themselves from the Allies, who rescued their country from extinction in the late war, and had they not sought refuge in what was proved to be a fatal neutrality, the French and British Armies might well at the outset have saved not only Belgium but perhaps even Poland. Yet at the last moment, when Belgium was already invaded, King Leopold called upon us to come to his aid, and even at the last moment we came. He and his brave, efficient Army, nearly half a million strong, guarded our left flank and thus kept open our only line of retreat to the sea. Suddenly, without prior consultation, with the least possible notice, without the advice of his Ministers and upon his own personal act, he sent a plenipotentiary to the German Command, surrendered his Army, and exposed our whole flank and means of retreat."

This resulted in the loss of contact between the British and two out of the three corps forming the First French Army. The enemy attacked on all sides with great strength, using their more numerous Air Force and firing cannons upon the beaches. They also sowed magnetic mines in the channels and seas, sent waves of hostile aircraft, and deployed U-boats and motor launches. The British and French Armies fought within an ever-narrowing and ever-contracting area, facing intense struggle from the enemy's armored divisions, infantry, and artillery.",

The surrender of the Belgian Army compelled the British at the shortest notice to cover a flank to the sea more than 30 miles in length. Otherwise all would have been cut off, and all would have shared the fate to which King Leopold had condemned the finest Army his country had ever formed. So in doing this and in exposing this flank, as anyone who followed the operations on the map will see, contact was lost between the British and two out of the three corps forming the First French Army, who were still farther from the coast than we were, and it seemed impossible that any large number of Allied troops could reach the coast.\n\nThe enemy attacked on all sides with great strength and fierceness, and their main power, the power of their far more numerous Air Force, was thrown into the battle or else concentrated upon Dunkirk and the beaches. Pressing in\n\nupon the narrow exit, both from the east and from the west, the enemy began to fire with cannon upon the beaches by which alone the shipping could approach or depart. They sowed magnetic mines in the channels and seas; they sent repeated waves of hostile aircraft, sometimes more than a hundred strong in one formation, to cast their bombs upon the single pier that remained, and upon the sand dunes upon which the troops had their eyes for shelter. Their U-boats, one of which was sunk, and their motor launches took their toll of the vast traffic which now began. For four or five days an intense struggle reigned. All their armored divisions-or what Was left of them-together with great masses of infantry and artillery, hurled themselves in vain upon the ever-narrowing, ever-contracting appendix within which the British and French Armies fought."

Nor were the seas, as I have said, themselves free from mines and torpedoes. It was in conditions such as these that our men carried on, with little or no rest, for days and nights on end, making trip after trip across the dangerous waters, bringing with them always men whom they had rescued.

This struggle was protracted and fierce. Suddenly the scene has cleared, the crash and thunder has for the moment-but only for the moment-died away. A miracle of deliverance, achieved by valor, by perseverance, by perfect discipline, by faultless service, by resource, by skill, by unconquerable fidelity, is manifest to us all. The enemy was hurled back by the retreating British and French troops. He was so roughly handled that he did not hurry their departure seriously. The Royal Air Force engaged the main strength of the German Air Force, and inflicted upon them losses of at least four to one; and the Navy, using nearly 1,000 ships of all kinds, carried over 335,000 men, French and British, out of the jaws of death and shame, to their native land and to the tasks which lie immediately ahead. We must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations. But there was a victory inside this deliverance, which should be noted. It was gained by the Air Force. Many of our soldiers coming back have not seen the Air Force at work; they saw only the bombers which escaped its protective attack. They underrate its achievements. I have heard much talk of this; that is why I go out of my way to say this. I will tell you about it."

Can you conceive a greater objective for the Germans in the air than to make evacuation from these beaches impossible, and to sink all these ships which were displayed, almost to the extent of thousands? Could there have been an objective of greater military importance and significance for the whole purpose of the war than this? They tried hard, and they were beaten back; they were frustrated in their task. We got the Army away; and they have paid fourfold for any losses which they have inflicted. Very large formations of German aeroplanes-and we know that they are a very brave race-have turned on several occasions from the attack of one-quarter of their number of the Royal Air Force, and have dispersed in different directions. Twelve aeroplanes have been hunted by two. One aeroplane was driven into the water and cast away by the mere charge of a British aeroplane, which had no more ammunition. All of our types-the Hurricane, the Spitfire and the new Defiant-and all our pilots have been vindicated as superior to what they have at present to face.\n\nWhen we consider how much greater would be our advantage in defending the air above this Island against an overseas attack, I must say that I find in these facts a sure basis upon which practical and reassuring thoughts may rest. I will pay my tribute to these young airmen. The great French Army was very largely, for the time being, cast back and disturbed by the onrush of a few thousands of armored vehicles. May it not also be that the cause of civilization itself will be defended by the skill and devotion of a few thousand airmen? There never has been, I suppose, in all the world, in all the history of war, such an opportunity for youth. The Knights of the Round Table, the Crusaders, all fall back into the past-not only distant but prosaic; these young men, going forth every morn to guard their native land and all that we stand for, holding in their hands these instruments of colossal and shattering power, of whom it may be said that Every morn brought forth a noble chance And every chance brought forth a noble knight, deserve our gratitude, as do all the brave men who, in so many ways and on so many occasions, are ready, and continue ready to give life and all for their native land."

They had the first-fruits of all that our industry had to give, and that is gone. And now here is this further delay. How long it will be, how long it will last, depends upon the exertions which we make in this Island. An effort the like of which has never been seen in our records is now being made.

Parliament has given us the powers to put down Fifth Column activities with a strong hand, and we shall use those powers subject to the supervision and correction of the House, without the slightest hesitation until we are satisfied, and more than satisfied, that this malignancy in our midst has been effectively stamped out.\n\nTurning once again, and this time more generally, to the question of invasion, I would observe that there has never been a period in all these long centuries of which we boast when an absolute guarantee against invasion, still less against serious raids, could have been given to our people. In the days of Napoleon the same wind which would have carried his transports across the Channel might have driven away the blockading fleet. There was always the chance, and it is that chance which has excited and befooled the imaginations of many Continental tyrants. Many are the tales that are told. We are assured that novel methods will be adopted, and when we see the originality of malice, the ingenuity of aggression, which our enemy displays, we may certainly prepare ourselves for every kind of novel stratagem and every kind of brutal and treacherous maneuver. I think that no idea is so outlandish that it should not be considered and viewed with a searching, but at the same time, I hope, with a steady eye.

        "answer": "From the moment that the French defenses at Sedan and on the Meuse were broken, a rapid retreat to Amiens and the south could have saved the British and French Armies. However, the French High Command initially hoped to close the gap and did not immediately realize the need for a retreat. When the force and scope of the German penetration were realized and a new French Generalissimo assumed command, an effort was made to hold the right hand of the Belgians and create a new French Army to advance across the Somme.",

The French High Command hoped they would be able to\nclose the gap, and the Armies of the north were under their orders. Moreover, a\nretirement of this kind would have involved almost certainly the destruction of\nthe fine Belgian Army of over 20 divisions and the abandonment of the whole of\nBelgium. Therefore, when the force and scope of the German penetration were\nrealized and when a new French Generalissimo, General Weygand, assumed command\nin place of General Gamelin, an effort was made by the French and British\nArmies in Belgium to keep on holding the right hand of the Belgians and to give\ntheir own right hand to a newly created French Army which was to have advanced\nacross the Somme in great strength to grasp it.\n\nHowever, the German\neruption swept like a sharp scythe around the right and rear of the Armies of\nthe north. Eight or nine armored divisions, each of about four hundred armored\nvehicles of different kinds, but carefully assorted to be complementary and\ndivisible into small self-contained units, cut off all communications between\nus and the main French Armies. It severed our own communications for food and\nammunition, which ran first to Amiens and afterwards through Abbeville, and it\nshore its way up the coast to Boulogne and Calais, and almost to Dunkirk.\nBehind this armored and mechanized onslaught came a number of German divisions\nin lorries, and behind them again there plodded comparatively slowly the dull\nbrute mass of the ordinary German Army and German people, always so ready to be\nled to the trampling down in other lands of liberties and comforts which they\nhave never known in their own."

        "question": "What was the significance of the defense of Boulogne and Calais?",
        "answer": "The defense of Boulogne and Calais was significant because it forced two armored divisions, which would have otherwise been used against the British Expeditionary Force, to be sent to overcome them. This diversion of resources allowed the port of Dunkirk to remain open and enabled the evacuation of the Belgian, British, and French Armies.",

The Guards defended Boulogne for a while and were\nthen withdrawn by orders from this country. The Rifle Brigade, the 60th Rifles,\nand the Queen Victoria\u2019s Rifles, with a battalion of British tanks and 1,000\nFrenchmen, in all about four thousand strong, defended Calais to the last. The\nBritish Brigadier was given an hour to surrender. He spurned the offer, and\nfour days of intense street fighting passed before silence reigned over Calais,\nwhich marked the end of a memorable resistance. Only 30 unwounded survivors\nwere brought off by the Navy, and we do not know the fate of their comrades.\nTheir sacrifice, however, was not in vain. At least two armored divisions,\nwhich otherwise would have been turned against the British Expeditionary Force,\nhad to be sent to overcome them. They have added another page to the glories of\nthe light divisions, and the time gained enabled the Graveline water lines to\nbe flooded and to be held by the French troops.\n\nThus it was that the\nport of Dunkirk was kept open. When it was found impossible for the Armies of\nthe north to reopen their communications to Amiens with the main French Armies,\nonly one choice remained. It seemed, indeed, forlorn. The Belgian, British and\nFrench Armies were almost surrounded. Their sole line of retreat was to a\nsingle port and to its neighboring beaches. They were pressed on every side by\nheavy attacks and far outnumbered in the air."

I thought-and some good judges agreed with me-that perhaps 20,000 or\n30,000 men might be re-embarked. But it certainly seemed that the whole of the\nFrench First Army and the whole of the British Expeditionary Force north of the\nAmiens-Abbeville gap would be broken up in the open field or else would have to\ncapitulate for lack of food and ammunition. These were the hard and heavy\ntidings for which I called upon the House and the nation to prepare themselves\na week ago. The whole root and core and brain of the British Army, on which and\naround which we were to build, and are to build, the great British Armies in\nthe later years of the war, seemed about to perish upon the field or to be led\ninto an ignominious and starving captivity.\n\nThat was the prospect a week\nago. But another blow which might well have proved final was yet to fall upon\nus. The King of the Belgians had called upon us to come to his aid. Had not\nthis Ruler and his Government severed themselves from the Allies, who rescued\ntheir country from extinction in the late war, and had they not sought refuge\nin what was proved to be a fatal neutrality, the French and British Armies\nmight well at the outset have saved not only Belgium but perhaps even Poland.\nYet at the last moment, when Belgium was already invaded, King Leopold called\nupon us to come to his aid, and even at the last moment we came. He and his\nbrave, efficient Army, nearly half a million strong, guarded our left flank and\nthus kept open our only line of retreat to the sea. Suddenly, without prior\nconsultation, with the least possible notice, without the advice of his\nMinisters and upon his own personal act, he sent a plenipotentiary to the\nGerman Command, surrendered his Army, and exposed our whole flank and means of\nretreat."

This resulted in the loss of contact between the British and two out of the three corps forming the First French Army. The enemy attacked with great strength and fierceness, using their far more numerous Air Force and concentrating their power on Dunkirk and the beaches. They also fired cannons upon the beaches, sowed magnetic mines in the channels and seas, and sent waves of hostile aircraft to bomb the remaining pier and the sand dunes where the troops sought shelter. Additionally, their U-boats and motor launches targeted the shipping traffic. The British and French Armies faced intense struggle as they fought within an ever-narrowing and ever-contracting area.",

Otherwise all would have been cut off,\nand all would have shared the fate to which King Leopold had condemned the\nfinest Army his country had ever formed. So in doing this and in exposing this\nflank, as anyone who followed the operations on the map will see, contact was\nlost between the British and two out of the three corps forming the First\nFrench Army, who were still farther from the coast than we were, and it seemed\nimpossible that any large number of Allied troops could reach the coast.\n\nThe enemy attacked on all sides with great strength and fierceness, and\ntheir main power, the power of their far more numerous Air Force, was thrown\ninto the battle or else concentrated upon Dunkirk and the beaches. Pressing in\nupon the narrow exit, both from the east and from the west, the enemy began to\nfire with cannon upon the beaches by which alone the shipping could approach or\ndepart. They sowed magnetic mines in the channels and seas; they sent repeated\nwaves of hostile aircraft, sometimes more than a hundred strong in one\nformation, to cast their bombs upon the single pier that remained, and upon the\nsand dunes upon which the troops had their eyes for shelter. Their U-boats, one\nof which was sunk, and their motor launches took their toll of the vast traffic\nwhich now began. For four or five days an intense struggle reigned. All their\narmored divisions-or what Was left of them-together with great masses of\ninfantry and artillery, hurled themselves in vain upon the ever-narrowing,\never-contracting appendix within which the British and French Armies\nfought."

A miracle of deliverance, achieved by valor, by perseverance, by perfect\ndiscipline, by faultless service, by resource, by skill, by unconquerable\nfidelity, is manifest to us all. The enemy was hurled back by the retreating\nBritish and French troops. He was so roughly handled that he did not hurry\ntheir departure seriously.

We must be very careful not to\nassign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by\nevacuations. But there was a victory inside this deliverance, which should be\nnoted. It was gained by the Air Force. Many of our soldiers coming back have\nnot seen the Air Force at work; they saw only the bombers which escaped its\nprotective attack. They underrate its achievements.

The average rate of inflation in developing countries and emerging economies is expected to be 5.9 per cent.\n\nAccording to the calculations of the Federal Statistical Office, Germany\u2019s GDP grew by 2.8 per cent in 2021 after having fallen by 4.6 per cent in the same period in the previous year. \u2018After economic performance had increased again last summer despite growing delivery bottlenecks and material shortages, the recovery of the German economy came to a halt at the end of the year due to the fourth Covid-19 wave and another reinforce- ment of Covid-19 preventive measures\u2019, reported the Federal Statistical Office in January 2022.

He announced that insurers reported an increase in premiums of 1.1 per cent (previous year: 1.6 per cent) across all segments, reaching 223.4 billion euros.\n\nThe outlook for 2022 is cautiously optimistic. Accord- ing to the GDV, the industry expects premium growth of between 2 and 3 per cent. With regard to life insur- ance, the Covid-19 pandemic can be expected to have an impact on business prospects in the current year too. Premium growth of between 1 and 2 per cent could be considered realistic here. The GDV expects a weaker performance from traditional life insurance products, although market-oriented products are expected to grow more strongly. \u2018The decisive factors here are the economic prospects of private households and the gen- eral political conditions for private old-age pensions in the current legislative period\u2019, said Weiler.\n\nThe GDV goes on to report that the premium income of life insurers and pension funds amounted to around 102 billion euros in the financial year ended. That amount is 1.4 per cent lower than in 2020. Whereas current pre- mium income increased slightly to 65.3 billion euros, one-time premiums declined to 36.5 billion euros (-4.7 per cent).\n\nAccording to the GDV, new Riester business performed well with growth of 12 per cent to 310,500 contracts. The portfolio largely remained stable, with around 10.4 mil- lion contracts. With regard to basic pensions, the num- ber of newly brokered policies increased by almost 40 per cent to 119,000 contracts. This caused the overall portfolio to grow by 4 per cent to 2.5 million contracts."

Additionally, the additional interest reserves have suppressed the risks of their long-term interest guarantees.\n\nThe persistently low interest rates were a concern of the insurance industry in the 2021 financial year as well. The ECB launched a multi-billion-euro emergen- cy purchase programme in March 2020 to mitigate the severe economic impacts of the Covid-19 crisis: under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), the ECB will purchase up to 1.85 billion euros\u2019 worth of government and corporate bonds until March 2022 at the earliest.\n\nIn September 2021, the ECB decided to reduce the rate of PEPP purchases moderately. The ECB announced its decision at the most recent ECB meeting on 3 February 2022. At the same time, the ECB left the key interest rate in the Eurozone at 0 per cent, while the deposit facili- ty rate also remained unchanged at -0.5 per cent. This means that banks must continue to pay penalty rates if they deposit surplus money with the ECB.\n\nIn light of the rapid rise in inflation, ECB President Christine Lagarde refused to rule out an interest rate increase this year. As such, the ECB is prepared to ad- just all available instruments in order to reach its 2 per cent inflation target in the medium term. Lagarde made an announcement to this effect at the press conference afterwards. According to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, the rate of inflation in Eurozone countries rose from 5.0 per cent in December 2021 to 5.1 per cent in January 2022. High energy costs were the main driver. According to the Federal Statistical Office, inflation in Germany fell to 4.9 per cent in January 2022 from 5.3 per cent in the previous month."

In particular, digitisa- tion has been accelerated greatly by the Covid-19 crisis. Digitised business processes enable the ever-greater integration of systems across divisions, segments and company boundaries. That makes it possible to exploit the potential represented by the standardisation and automation of processes to a greater extent. Fully auto- mated processes lead to enormous gains with regard to efficiency as well as significantly lower costs.\n\nIn Europe, the insurance industry largely managed to remain on track in 2020, the first year of the pandemic, according to the European Insurance Study 2021 pub- lished by Zeb Consulting in December 2021. Although insurers did have to accept larger drops in profits and premiums in some cases, the industry was in good over- all condition when it was hit by the crisis, enabling it to mostly remain profitable.

The msg life Group therefore attaches a great deal of importance to its cooperation with customers in the user and operator groups as well as with partners (IBM or the msg Group, for example) in relation to its most important products. The approaches devised with-\n\nin the framework of research are presented, discussed and evaluated within the user and operator groups at an early stage and, if required, on a cross-product basis. The evaluation is conducted with particular regard to users\u2019 interest in acquiring the product enhancements. In this way, new releases of standard software products are generally partially financed by advance orders from some of the customers.\n\nAs there are no user groups that can be accessed for the placement of new products or the opening up of new markets, early customer models are used which reward a customer\u2019s early decision in favour of a new product with commercial benefits.\n\nPurchasing R & D expertise\n\nIn its capacity as market leader in its core business, the msg life Group is usually unable to have recourse to ready-made external research findings. This particularly applies to specialist thematic areas in the customers\u2019 sectors. As a sector-specific service provider, the com-\n\nT N E M E G A N A M\n\n20\n\npany prefers to rely on its own research, which builds upon its participation in trade conferences, association activities and joint projects with partner companies.

It goes without saying that the qualification level of the Group\u2019s em- ployees is updated continuously by means of selective (also external) ongoing training activities. In the tech- nology sector, msg life makes use of rapidly develop- ing standards and non-proprietary technologies right\n\nthrough to freely available open-source products.

        "answer": "Personnel risks refer to the potential risks associated with the employees of a company. In the given text, it is mentioned that there is a risk that msg life employees may fall ill and be unable to work on customer projects, or that customers may be unable to perform necessary supporting services. This can result in a negative impact on the economic development of the company. Personnel risks can also include issues such as employee turnover, lack of necessary skills or expertise, and the need for ongoing training and development.",

These risks are controlled and monitored by means of the valid Group-wide stan- dards for project and project risk management. The risk nevertheless remains that projects cannot be realised profitably for the msg life Group because costs exceed the agreed budget, deadlines cannot be met or the ser- vices rendered fail to comply with the agreed functional specifications or the required quality, and the msg life Group will therefore have to grant a discount or pay com- pensation. The overall risk profile of all ongoing projects was further reduced in 2021. The existing risks of indi- vidual projects have been appropriately taken into ac- count for 2022. The cumulative occurrence in multiple projects could, however, lead to negative effects.\n\nIn the 2021 financial year, particular attention was paid to the potential impact of the current Covid-19 pan- demic on the company. The company was quick to take comprehensive action in order to remain operational including, in particular, providing all employees with the necessary hardware and software to work remotely from home and moving almost all work to cyberspace both quickly and consistently. Nevertheless, there is a risk that msg life employees fall ill and are unable to work on customer projects or that customers are unable to perform the necessary supporting services.

        "question": "What are some of the personnel risks that msg life faces?",
        "answer": "Personnel risks for msg life include the challenge of getting key employees to commit to the company, recruiting and developing qualified employees, and the potential loss of expertise. Additionally, there is a risk of burdening the company's own employees, which may require expensive external resources to prevent quality losses in project development. This risk is exacerbated by the likely decline in graduate numbers, increased competition for recruitment, and rising costs.",

Certain em- ployees in key positions are particularly important in this respect. If msg life is unable to get these employ- ees to commit themselves to the company or to recruit qualified and skilled employees and develop them fur- ther on a continuous basis, msg life\u2019s success can suffer significant adverse effects due to the resultant loss of expertise. In addition, an excessive burden on the com- pany\u2019s own employees could necessitate the deploy- ment of expensive external capacities if the risk of qual- ity losses in project development is to be averted. This applies particularly when the likely demographic trends are taken into consideration. In connection with this, msg life will be affected particularly by the probable de- cline in graduate numbers, the resultant competition to recruit them and the increasing costs this will lead to.\n\nmsg life counters this risk with an extensive set of mea- sures. A continuous exchange of views with the em- ployees on all factors affecting their work environment at standardised interviews with a facility for qualified feedback, internal training to prevent monopolies of knowledge and skills, on-the-job graduate training and the recruitment of suitable people through all of the usual market channels are just a few examples of these.

An economic downturn could reduce the volume of the market on which msg life has trained its sights. Any capacity adjustment mea- sures which are regarded as necessary to counter such developments might take effect only after a time lag and would lead to restructuring costs. With the volume-re- lated remuneration models, a delay in portfolio growth caused by the general economic situation could result in a postponement of the planned diminution in fixed costs."

        "answer": "msg life faces economic risks such as falling demand during economic crises, which may affect existing customers more slowly due to their loyalty to the solution deployed. However, new customers may postpone planned investments, leading to reductions in turnover. Additionally, the company is exposed to risks related to the availability and secure operational capacity of its IT infrastructure, including external events like fire or network failures, operational errors, and acts of sabotage. The IT systems of msg life and its customers can also be vulnerable to viruses and cyber attacks, which can cause damage, distort or delete information, and result in unauthorized access to confidential data. These risks can lead to recovery expenses, loss of production, and recourse claims from customers and third parties, potentially impacting the company's earnings and future. The economic risks also extend to external factors like the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, although at the time of preparing the annual financial statements, msg life does not anticipate significant impacts on its economic or operational development.",

With regard to new customers, post- ponements of planned investments can lead to reduc- tions in turnover, especially in product business.\n\nAs with all comparable companies, the functional ca- pacity of the business processes is also dependent on the availability and secure operational capacity of the IT infrastructure. External events such as fire, lengthy power or network failures, operational errors or acts of sabotage can, among other things, render the IT infra- structure inoperable. The msg life systems, and also those of its customers, can succumb to viruses which damage and incapacitate the systems or the network. Internal or external attacks can damage, distort or de- lete information and can result in confidential data and information being accessed. The probability and the extent of damage caused by viruses and hackers, by unauthorised persons accessing the IT system and by confidential information being accessed cannot be esti- mated to the fullest extent.\n\nRecovery expenses, loss of production and recourse claims from customers and third parties as a result of system breakdowns or attacks could cause significant damage which, in turn, could influence earnings and endanger the future of the company.\n\nAll of the aforementioned economic risks also apply to the current Covid-19 pandemic. In light of the develop- ment of its business with new and existing customers and its project business in the reporting period and in 2022 so far, the company does not foresee any signif- icant impact on its economic or operational develop- ment at the time of writing of these annual financial statements.\n\nThe aforementioned economic risks also apply to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February of this year and the resulting economic sanctions against Russia. It is impossible to judge the economic effects of this cri- sis on the course of business of the msg life Group in 2022.

This can also be supported in parallel by strategic acquisitions.

A total of 90 per cent of its revenues are generated in eurozone countries (previous year: 87 per cent), and the remainder in Swit- zerland and the United States. The currency risk on the asset side in relation to trade receivables comes from receivables not denominated in euros, accounting for 15 per cent (previous year: 13 per cent). In the case of trade payables, currency risks occur in relation to the 3 per cent of liabilities not denominated in euros (previ- ous year: 5 per cent). Differences arising from currency conversion of financial statements from a foreign cur- rency to the Group currency for the creation of consol- idated financial statements do not affect currency risk because the respective changes in foreign currency are recognised under equity with no effect on income.\n\nMarket risks:\n\nMarket risks result from changes in market prices.

Overall, msg life continues to enjoy steady growth in the various insurance sectors in the US market and intends to exploit the potential for business that this represents. In addition to the implementation and integration of specific software products, the range of services offered by msg life encompasses a variety of consulting services in connection with product and tar- iff modelling, for example, as well as operator models \u2013 these are generating growing interest in the market.\n\nThe target group of the msg life Group company there is predominantly health and group insurers and, in fu- ture, will also include life insurers on the basis of the US product portfolio. The expansion and diversification of the company\u2019s own range of solutions and partner- ships with specialised service providers are being used to unlock new customer groups. Now that the Biden ad- ministration has built on the Patient Protection and Af- fordable Care Act, msg life expects the state healthcare programmes such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid to grow further with the sales opportu- nities this provides. In the US market, msg life is also examining the potential for a commercial partnership in the field of health insurance.\n\nFollowing an excellent 2021 financial year, msg life is registering a high level of demand for solutions in the first quarter of the current 2022 financial year \u2013 from insurance companies in Germany and other countries in equal measure. In this context, msg life also expects to see further regulation throughout the financial ser- vices sector. Be it the revision of Solvency II, the new international accounting standard IFRS 17, the Europe- an Transparency Directive, the rollout of a digital pen- sion overview or the introduction of PEPP, the ongoing implementation of numerous regulatory requirements necessitates comprehensive changes to the solutions which are currently used and ties up vast amounts of insurers\u2019 resources. This means that the use of versatile, cost-effective standard software remains highly attrac- tive throughout the insurance industry."

In the process, almost all insurers are striving to enhance their existing pro- duct ranges and develop new, innovative ones \u2013 this goes for all existing product groups, control layers and legal forms. The companies\u2019 starting situations and the pressure on them to innovate vary and are consequent- ly bringing about a variety of innovations. The focus is on products that tick more than one box at the same time: products that satisfy the desire of the policyhold- ers for security, returns and flexibility, meet the needs of the insurer in terms of more efficiency and profitabil- ity and comply with the regulatory requirements at the same time.\n\nIn terms of the conventional capital accumulation pro- ducts, modifications of the guarantees are dominant, for example through the use of current calculation guidelines or by dispensing with the annual interest guarantee. With the biometric products, too, there is a great deal of action on the market. Dynamic hybrid products have become the standard now and there is a continuous flow of innovative products in addition to them which allow, for example, investment in funds, but also the purchasing of options on the basis of tra- ditional basic cover. Insurance companies at the larger end of the scale in particular are offering products for old-age provision with capital guarantees on the basis of unit-linked approaches with investment guarantees."

            "context": "Given the current challenges, microservice-oriented ar- chitectures designed to quickly support modified busi- ness models and high system versatility for the rapid in- troduction of innovative products are factors crucial to the success of insurance companies. The developments in insurance products described above are typically not associated with particular product families. The plat- form economy is also playing a key role in the insurance industry this year: numerous insurers are now using platforms and ecosystems to provide digital products and services beyond what had previously been their core business \u2013 this in turn is opening up new ways to create value.\n\nFor larger insurance companies, the acquisition of closed insurance contract portfolios that are no lon- ger available for sale (\u2018run-off\u2019 portfolios) from mainly smaller insurance companies remains an important fac- tor. This enables the latter to generate positive effects for their books, and buyers can generate significant economies of scale and cost synergies. Modern asset management with modern and powerful IT systems plays a decisive role in this regard as well in the more efficient management of contracts.\n\nThe digitisation of our economy and society has been accelerated greatly by the Covid-19 pandemic and re- mains one of the most significant challenges facing the German insurance industry. Digitised business pro- cesses enable the ever-greater integration of systems across divisions, segments and company boundaries. That makes it possible to exploit the potential repre- sented by the standardisation and automation of pro- cesses to a greater extent. Fully automated processes lead to enormous gains with regard to efficiency as well as significantly lower costs. The subjects of customer centricity and individualisation, industrialisation and automation, analytics and data effectiveness, and stan- dardisation and integration are at the heart of the digi- tisation trend. Insurers are increasingly committed to cloud solutions with which IT capacities can be adapted to meet the level of demand in a flexible manner.\n\nWith digitisation, modern insurance products and ser- vices can be made available on new channels or inte- grated into new sales and cooperation platforms; all of this requires extensive changes to the IT landscapes of insurers in order for the new technology and platforms to be integrated and is taken into account by msg life when it develops its products and services. The compa- ny already has SaaS and cloud-based solutions to sup- port its customers with the digitisation process, thanks in no small part to its strategic collaboration with IBM."

These DNNs will enable life insurers to replace old system generations, map their core functions with artificial intelligence and integrate them into a modern system.\n\nFurther development of products and services\n\nmsg life is pressing ahead with the further technical and functional optimisation and completion of its product range in the fields of life insurance and pensions.

Its software solutions primarily support life insur- ance companies and pension fund institutions in Europe and in particular health and group insurance companies in the United States in the design, implementation and administration of their products.\n\nThe headquarters of the msg life Group are at Humboldtstrasse 35, 70771 Lein- felden-Echterdingen, Germany. msg life ag is a joint stock company in accordance with German law. It is listed in the commercial register of the Stuttgart District Court under HRB 731887.\n\nThese consolidated financial statements of msg life ag, Leinfelden-Echterdingen, Ger- many (hereinafter referred to as \u2018msg life ag\u2019), as at 31 December 2021, encompass the parent company and all of the subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018msg life Group\u2019). The reporting year corresponds to the calendar year.\n\nOn 14 April 2022, the Management Board of msg life ag approved the consolidated financial statements for forwarding to the Supervisory Board, and therefore for pub- lication. The Supervisory Board has the task of examining the consolidated financial statements and declaring whether it approves the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs it has not made use of the exemption in section 291, paragraph 1, of the German Commercial Code (HGB), the company is obliged to prepare consolidated financial statements pursuant to section 290 of the HGB. As at 31 December 2021, the company prepared consolidated financial statements and its condensed management report and Group management report in accordance with German GAAP pursuant to section 290 et seq. of the HGB and section 150 et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).\n\nFor reasons of clarity and comprehensibility, all legally prescribed annotations in rela- tion to items in the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated income statement are shown in the notes.\n\nThe consolidated income statement was prepared according to the total-cost method."

Looking at the 2021 financial year, however, it is once again evident that the pandemic did not have a sig- nificant effect on msg life\u2019s business. For this reason \u2013 and also because of the steps taken by msg life and the performance of its project business in the current financial year 2022 \u2013 the company still sees no significant effects on its operating and financial performance as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic at the time these financial state-\n\nmsg life\n\nrethinking insurance\n\nAnnual Report 2021\n\n39\n\nments were prepared.

If it is likely to be permanently impaired, it is written down. The goodwill was already fully amortised as at 31 December 2021.\n\nThe company has opted not to recognise internally generated intangible fixed assets pursuant to section 248, paragraph 2, sentence 1, of the HGB.\n\nFixed assets are carried at original cost, less regular linear depreciation in the case of depreciable assets. The useful lives are between three and ten years. Depreciable movable fixed assets that can be used independently and whose (net) costs per indi- vidual item exceed 250 euros, but not 800 euros, qualify as low-value assets and are immediately recognised as expenses in the year of acquisition.\n\nAssets with a cost of less than 250 euros are recognised as expenses.\n\nInventories are measured at historical cost. Apart from the unit costs, the costs of production also include an appropriate proportion of the overhead costs and write- downs. The loss-free valuation rule is observed. Work contracts which extend across multiple financial years are treated as work in progress until the milestone is deliv- ered, fully or in part, to the customer. Advance payments received on account of or- ders are written off openly from inventories."

According to the temporary concept, deferred taxes are formed for all temporary and virtually per- manent accounting and measurement differences between the values of assets and liabilities recognised under commercial and tax law.\n\nWhen the deferred tax assets are determined, deferred tax assets on losses carried forward must be taken into account in the amount of the offset of losses that is to be expected within the next five years. Accordingly, no deferred tax assets were rec- ognised for tax losses on 31 December 2021, taking their realisability into account."
