Essentially, this development was due to the fact that securities were 12.4 million euros higher and accounts receivable were 6.9 million euros higher as at the re- porting date. On the other hand, liquid funds decreased by 5.0 million euros from 22.9 million euros to 17.9 mil- lion euros, which had the opposite effect.
