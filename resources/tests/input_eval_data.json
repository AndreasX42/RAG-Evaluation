        "answer": "From the moment that the French defenses at Sedan and on the Meuse were broken, a rapid retreat to Amiens and the south could have saved the British and French Armies. However, the French High Command hoped to close the gap and keep holding the right hand of the Belgians. The German eruption swept around the right and rear of the Armies of the north, cutting off all communications and severing supply lines. Boulogne and Calais were scenes of desperate fighting, but the armored scythe-stroke almost reached Dunkirk.",

The French High Command hoped they would be able to\n\nclose the gap, and the Armies of the north were under their orders. Moreover, a\n\nretirement of this kind would have involved almost certainly the destruction of\n\nthe fine Belgian Army of over 20 divisions and the abandonment of the whole of\n\nBelgium. Therefore, when the force and scope of the German penetration were\n\nrealized and when a new French Generalissimo, General Weygand, assumed command\n\nin place of General Gamelin, an effort was made by the French and British\n\nArmies in Belgium to keep on holding the right hand of the Belgians and to give\n\ntheir own right hand to a newly created French Army which was to have advanced\n\nacross the Somme in great strength to grasp it.\n\n\n\nHowever, the German\n\neruption swept like a sharp scythe around the right and rear of the Armies of\n\nthe north. Eight or nine armored divisions, each of about four hundred armored\n\nvehicles of different kinds, but carefully assorted to be complementary and\n\ndivisible into small self-contained units, cut off all communications between\n\nus and the main French Armies. It severed our own communications for food and\n\nammunition, which ran first to Amiens and afterwards through Abbeville, and it\n\nshore its way up the coast to Boulogne and Calais, and almost to Dunkirk.\n\nBehind this armored and mechanized onslaught came a number of German divisions\n\nin lorries, and behind them again there plodded comparatively slowly the dull\n\nbrute mass of the ordinary German Army and German people, always so ready to be\n\nled to the trampling down in other lands of liberties and comforts which they\n\nhave never known in their own.\n\n\n\nI have said this armored scythe-stroke\n\nalmost reached Dunkirk-almost but not quite. Boulogne and Calais were the\n\nscenes of desperate fighting. The Guards defended Boulogne for a while and were\n\nthen withdrawn by orders from this country. The Rifle Brigade, the 60th Rifles,"

        "answer": "The defense of Calais was a memorable resistance where about four thousand soldiers, including the Queen Victoria's Rifles, British tanks, and 1,000 Frenchmen, defended the city to the last. Despite being outnumbered, they fought for four days of intense street fighting before silence reigned over Calais. Only 30 unwounded survivors were brought off by the Navy, and the fate of their comrades is unknown. Their sacrifice, however, was not in vain as their resistance forced at least two armored divisions, which would have been turned against the British Expeditionary Force, to be sent to overcome them. This delay also allowed the French troops to flood and hold the Graveline water lines, keeping the port of Dunkirk open.",

Only 30 unwounded survivors\n\nwere brought off by the Navy, and we do not know the fate of their comrades.\n\nTheir sacrifice, however, was not in vain. At least two armored divisions,\n\nwhich otherwise would have been turned against the British Expeditionary Force,\n\nhad to be sent to overcome them.

When it was found impossible for the Armies of\n\nthe north to reopen their communications to Amiens with the main French Armies,\n\nonly one choice remained. It seemed, indeed, forlorn.

Had not\n\nthis Ruler and his Government severed themselves from the Allies, who rescued\n\ntheir country from extinction in the late war, and had they not sought refuge\n\nin what was proved to be a fatal neutrality, the French and British Armies\n\nmight well at the outset have saved not only Belgium but perhaps even Poland.\n\nYet at the last moment, when Belgium was already invaded, King Leopold called\n\nupon us to come to his aid, and even at the last moment we came. He and his\n\nbrave, efficient Army, nearly half a million strong, guarded our left flank and\n\nthus kept open our only line of retreat to the sea. Suddenly, without prior\n\nconsultation, with the least possible notice, without the advice of his\n\nMinisters and upon his own personal act, he sent a plenipotentiary to the\n\nGerman Command, surrendered his Army, and exposed our whole flank and means of\n\nretreat.\n\n\n\nI asked the House a week ago to suspend its judgment because\n\nthe facts were not clear, but I do not feel that any reason now exists why we\n\nshould not form our own opinions upon this pitiful episode.

Their U-boats, one\n\nof which was sunk, and their motor launches took their toll of the vast traffic\n\nwhich now began. For four or five days an intense struggle reigned.

        "answer": "From the moment that the French defenses at Sedan and on the Meuse were broken, a rapid retreat to Amiens and the south could have saved the British and French Armies. However, the French High Command initially hoped to close the gap and did not immediately realize the need for a retreat. When the force and scope of the German penetration were realized, a new French Generalissimo, General Weygand, assumed command and an effort was made to hold the right hand of the Belgians and give their own right hand to a newly created French Army.",

            "context": "From the moment that the French defenses at Sedan and on the Meuse were broken at the end of the second week of May, only a rapid retreat to Amiens and the south could have saved the British and French Armies who had entered Belgium at the appeal of the Belgian King; but this strategic fact was not immediately realized. The French High Command hoped they would be able to close the gap, and the Armies of the north were under their orders. Moreover, a retirement of this kind would have involved almost certainly the destruction of the fine Belgian Army of over 20 divisions and the abandonment of the whole of Belgium. Therefore, when the force and scope of the German penetration were realized and when a new French Generalissimo, General Weygand, assumed command in place of General Gamelin, an effort was made by the French and British Armies in Belgium to keep on holding the right hand of the Belgians and to give their own right hand to a newly created French Army which was to have advanced across the Somme in great strength to grasp it.\n\nHowever, the German eruption swept like a sharp scythe around the right and rear of the Armies of the north. Eight or nine armored divisions, each of about four hundred armored vehicles of different kinds, but carefully assorted to be complementary and divisible into small self-contained units, cut off all communications between us and the main French Armies. It severed our own communications for food and ammunition, which ran first to Amiens and afterwards through Abbeville, and it shore its way up the coast to Boulogne and Calais, and almost to Dunkirk. Behind this armored and mechanized onslaught came a number of German divisions in lorries, and behind them again there plodded comparatively slowly the dull brute mass of the ordinary German Army and German people, always so ready to be led to the trampling down in other lands of liberties and comforts which they have never known in their own."

        "question": "What was the significance of the defense of Boulogne and Calais?",
        "answer": "The defense of Boulogne and Calais was significant because it forced at least two armored divisions, which would have otherwise been used against the British Expeditionary Force, to be diverted to overcome the defenders. This diversion of resources bought valuable time for the Allies and allowed the port of Dunkirk to remain open, providing a crucial evacuation route for the surrounded Belgian, British, and French Armies.",

The Guards defended Boulogne for a while and were then withdrawn by orders from this country. The Rifle Brigade, the 60th Rifles, and the Queen Victoria\u2019s Rifles, with a battalion of British tanks and 1,000 Frenchmen, in all about four thousand strong, defended Calais to the last. The British Brigadier was given an hour to surrender. He spurned the offer, and four days of intense street fighting passed before silence reigned over Calais, which marked the end of a memorable resistance. Only 30 unwounded survivors were brought off by the Navy, and we do not know the fate of their comrades. Their sacrifice, however, was not in vain. At least two armored divisions, which otherwise would have been turned against the British Expeditionary Force, had to be sent to overcome them. They have added another page to the glories of the light divisions, and the time gained enabled the Graveline water lines to be flooded and to be held by the French troops.\n\nThus it was that the port of Dunkirk was kept open. When it was found impossible for the Armies of the north to reopen their communications to Amiens with the main French Armies, only one choice remained. It seemed, indeed, forlorn. The Belgian, British and\n\nFrench Armies were almost surrounded. Their sole line of retreat was to a single port and to its neighboring beaches. They were pressed on every side by heavy attacks and far outnumbered in the air."

I thought-and some good judges agreed with me-that perhaps 20,000 or 30,000 men might be re-embarked. But it certainly seemed that the whole of the French First Army and the whole of the British Expeditionary Force north of the Amiens-Abbeville gap would be broken up in the open field or else would have to capitulate for lack of food and ammunition. These were the hard and heavy tidings for which I called upon the House and the nation to prepare themselves a week ago. The whole root and core and brain of the British Army, on which and around which we were to build, and are to build, the great British Armies in the later years of the war, seemed about to perish upon the field or to be led into an ignominious and starving captivity.\n\nThat was the prospect a week ago. But another blow which might well have proved final was yet to fall upon us. The King of the Belgians had called upon us to come to his aid. Had not this Ruler and his Government severed themselves from the Allies, who rescued their country from extinction in the late war, and had they not sought refuge in what was proved to be a fatal neutrality, the French and British Armies might well at the outset have saved not only Belgium but perhaps even Poland. Yet at the last moment, when Belgium was already invaded, King Leopold called upon us to come to his aid, and even at the last moment we came. He and his brave, efficient Army, nearly half a million strong, guarded our left flank and thus kept open our only line of retreat to the sea. Suddenly, without prior consultation, with the least possible notice, without the advice of his Ministers and upon his own personal act, he sent a plenipotentiary to the German Command, surrendered his Army, and exposed our whole flank and means of retreat."

This resulted in the loss of contact between the British and two out of the three corps forming the First French Army. The enemy attacked on all sides with great strength, using their more numerous Air Force and firing cannons upon the beaches. They also sowed magnetic mines in the channels and seas, sent waves of hostile aircraft, and deployed U-boats and motor launches. The British and French Armies fought within an ever-narrowing and ever-contracting area, facing intense struggle from the enemy's armored divisions, infantry, and artillery.",

The surrender of the Belgian Army compelled the British at the shortest notice to cover a flank to the sea more than 30 miles in length. Otherwise all would have been cut off, and all would have shared the fate to which King Leopold had condemned the finest Army his country had ever formed. So in doing this and in exposing this flank, as anyone who followed the operations on the map will see, contact was lost between the British and two out of the three corps forming the First French Army, who were still farther from the coast than we were, and it seemed impossible that any large number of Allied troops could reach the coast.\n\nThe enemy attacked on all sides with great strength and fierceness, and their main power, the power of their far more numerous Air Force, was thrown into the battle or else concentrated upon Dunkirk and the beaches. Pressing in\n\nupon the narrow exit, both from the east and from the west, the enemy began to fire with cannon upon the beaches by which alone the shipping could approach or depart. They sowed magnetic mines in the channels and seas; they sent repeated waves of hostile aircraft, sometimes more than a hundred strong in one formation, to cast their bombs upon the single pier that remained, and upon the sand dunes upon which the troops had their eyes for shelter. Their U-boats, one of which was sunk, and their motor launches took their toll of the vast traffic which now began. For four or five days an intense struggle reigned. All their armored divisions-or what Was left of them-together with great masses of infantry and artillery, hurled themselves in vain upon the ever-narrowing, ever-contracting appendix within which the British and French Armies fought."

Nor were the seas, as I have said, themselves free from mines and torpedoes. It was in conditions such as these that our men carried on, with little or no rest, for days and nights on end, making trip after trip across the dangerous waters, bringing with them always men whom they had rescued.

This struggle was protracted and fierce. Suddenly the scene has cleared, the crash and thunder has for the moment-but only for the moment-died away. A miracle of deliverance, achieved by valor, by perseverance, by perfect discipline, by faultless service, by resource, by skill, by unconquerable fidelity, is manifest to us all. The enemy was hurled back by the retreating British and French troops. He was so roughly handled that he did not hurry their departure seriously. The Royal Air Force engaged the main strength of the German Air Force, and inflicted upon them losses of at least four to one; and the Navy, using nearly 1,000 ships of all kinds, carried over 335,000 men, French and British, out of the jaws of death and shame, to their native land and to the tasks which lie immediately ahead. We must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations. But there was a victory inside this deliverance, which should be noted. It was gained by the Air Force. Many of our soldiers coming back have not seen the Air Force at work; they saw only the bombers which escaped its protective attack. They underrate its achievements. I have heard much talk of this; that is why I go out of my way to say this. I will tell you about it."

Can you conceive a greater objective for the Germans in the air than to make evacuation from these beaches impossible, and to sink all these ships which were displayed, almost to the extent of thousands? Could there have been an objective of greater military importance and significance for the whole purpose of the war than this? They tried hard, and they were beaten back; they were frustrated in their task. We got the Army away; and they have paid fourfold for any losses which they have inflicted. Very large formations of German aeroplanes-and we know that they are a very brave race-have turned on several occasions from the attack of one-quarter of their number of the Royal Air Force, and have dispersed in different directions. Twelve aeroplanes have been hunted by two. One aeroplane was driven into the water and cast away by the mere charge of a British aeroplane, which had no more ammunition. All of our types-the Hurricane, the Spitfire and the new Defiant-and all our pilots have been vindicated as superior to what they have at present to face.\n\nWhen we consider how much greater would be our advantage in defending the air above this Island against an overseas attack, I must say that I find in these facts a sure basis upon which practical and reassuring thoughts may rest. I will pay my tribute to these young airmen. The great French Army was very largely, for the time being, cast back and disturbed by the onrush of a few thousands of armored vehicles. May it not also be that the cause of civilization itself will be defended by the skill and devotion of a few thousand airmen? There never has been, I suppose, in all the world, in all the history of war, such an opportunity for youth. The Knights of the Round Table, the Crusaders, all fall back into the past-not only distant but prosaic; these young men, going forth every morn to guard their native land and all that we stand for, holding in their hands these instruments of colossal and shattering power, of whom it may be said that Every morn brought forth a noble chance And every chance brought forth a noble knight, deserve our gratitude, as do all the brave men who, in so many ways and on so many occasions, are ready, and continue ready to give life and all for their native land."

They had the first-fruits of all that our industry had to give, and that is gone. And now here is this further delay. How long it will be, how long it will last, depends upon the exertions which we make in this Island. An effort the like of which has never been seen in our records is now being made.

Parliament has given us the powers to put down Fifth Column activities with a strong hand, and we shall use those powers subject to the supervision and correction of the House, without the slightest hesitation until we are satisfied, and more than satisfied, that this malignancy in our midst has been effectively stamped out.\n\nTurning once again, and this time more generally, to the question of invasion, I would observe that there has never been a period in all these long centuries of which we boast when an absolute guarantee against invasion, still less against serious raids, could have been given to our people. In the days of Napoleon the same wind which would have carried his transports across the Channel might have driven away the blockading fleet. There was always the chance, and it is that chance which has excited and befooled the imaginations of many Continental tyrants. Many are the tales that are told. We are assured that novel methods will be adopted, and when we see the originality of malice, the ingenuity of aggression, which our enemy displays, we may certainly prepare ourselves for every kind of novel stratagem and every kind of brutal and treacherous maneuver. I think that no idea is so outlandish that it should not be considered and viewed with a searching, but at the same time, I hope, with a steady eye.

        "answer": "From the moment that the French defenses at Sedan and on the Meuse were broken, a rapid retreat to Amiens and the south could have saved the British and French Armies. However, the French High Command initially hoped to close the gap and did not immediately realize the need for a retreat. When the force and scope of the German penetration were realized and a new French Generalissimo assumed command, an effort was made to hold the right hand of the Belgians and create a new French Army to advance across the Somme.",

The French High Command hoped they would be able to\nclose the gap, and the Armies of the north were under their orders. Moreover, a\nretirement of this kind would have involved almost certainly the destruction of\nthe fine Belgian Army of over 20 divisions and the abandonment of the whole of\nBelgium. Therefore, when the force and scope of the German penetration were\nrealized and when a new French Generalissimo, General Weygand, assumed command\nin place of General Gamelin, an effort was made by the French and British\nArmies in Belgium to keep on holding the right hand of the Belgians and to give\ntheir own right hand to a newly created French Army which was to have advanced\nacross the Somme in great strength to grasp it.\n\nHowever, the German\neruption swept like a sharp scythe around the right and rear of the Armies of\nthe north. Eight or nine armored divisions, each of about four hundred armored\nvehicles of different kinds, but carefully assorted to be complementary and\ndivisible into small self-contained units, cut off all communications between\nus and the main French Armies. It severed our own communications for food and\nammunition, which ran first to Amiens and afterwards through Abbeville, and it\nshore its way up the coast to Boulogne and Calais, and almost to Dunkirk.\nBehind this armored and mechanized onslaught came a number of German divisions\nin lorries, and behind them again there plodded comparatively slowly the dull\nbrute mass of the ordinary German Army and German people, always so ready to be\nled to the trampling down in other lands of liberties and comforts which they\nhave never known in their own."

        "question": "What was the significance of the defense of Boulogne and Calais?",
        "answer": "The defense of Boulogne and Calais was significant because it forced two armored divisions, which would have otherwise been used against the British Expeditionary Force, to be sent to overcome them. This diversion of resources allowed the port of Dunkirk to remain open and enabled the evacuation of the Belgian, British, and French Armies.",

The Guards defended Boulogne for a while and were\nthen withdrawn by orders from this country. The Rifle Brigade, the 60th Rifles,\nand the Queen Victoria\u2019s Rifles, with a battalion of British tanks and 1,000\nFrenchmen, in all about four thousand strong, defended Calais to the last. The\nBritish Brigadier was given an hour to surrender. He spurned the offer, and\nfour days of intense street fighting passed before silence reigned over Calais,\nwhich marked the end of a memorable resistance. Only 30 unwounded survivors\nwere brought off by the Navy, and we do not know the fate of their comrades.\nTheir sacrifice, however, was not in vain. At least two armored divisions,\nwhich otherwise would have been turned against the British Expeditionary Force,\nhad to be sent to overcome them. They have added another page to the glories of\nthe light divisions, and the time gained enabled the Graveline water lines to\nbe flooded and to be held by the French troops.\n\nThus it was that the\nport of Dunkirk was kept open. When it was found impossible for the Armies of\nthe north to reopen their communications to Amiens with the main French Armies,\nonly one choice remained. It seemed, indeed, forlorn. The Belgian, British and\nFrench Armies were almost surrounded. Their sole line of retreat was to a\nsingle port and to its neighboring beaches. They were pressed on every side by\nheavy attacks and far outnumbered in the air."

I thought-and some good judges agreed with me-that perhaps 20,000 or\n30,000 men might be re-embarked. But it certainly seemed that the whole of the\nFrench First Army and the whole of the British Expeditionary Force north of the\nAmiens-Abbeville gap would be broken up in the open field or else would have to\ncapitulate for lack of food and ammunition. These were the hard and heavy\ntidings for which I called upon the House and the nation to prepare themselves\na week ago. The whole root and core and brain of the British Army, on which and\naround which we were to build, and are to build, the great British Armies in\nthe later years of the war, seemed about to perish upon the field or to be led\ninto an ignominious and starving captivity.\n\nThat was the prospect a week\nago. But another blow which might well have proved final was yet to fall upon\nus. The King of the Belgians had called upon us to come to his aid. Had not\nthis Ruler and his Government severed themselves from the Allies, who rescued\ntheir country from extinction in the late war, and had they not sought refuge\nin what was proved to be a fatal neutrality, the French and British Armies\nmight well at the outset have saved not only Belgium but perhaps even Poland.\nYet at the last moment, when Belgium was already invaded, King Leopold called\nupon us to come to his aid, and even at the last moment we came. He and his\nbrave, efficient Army, nearly half a million strong, guarded our left flank and\nthus kept open our only line of retreat to the sea. Suddenly, without prior\nconsultation, with the least possible notice, without the advice of his\nMinisters and upon his own personal act, he sent a plenipotentiary to the\nGerman Command, surrendered his Army, and exposed our whole flank and means of\nretreat."

This resulted in the loss of contact between the British and two out of the three corps forming the First French Army. The enemy attacked with great strength and fierceness, using their far more numerous Air Force and concentrating their power on Dunkirk and the beaches. They also fired cannons upon the beaches, sowed magnetic mines in the channels and seas, and sent waves of hostile aircraft to bomb the remaining pier and the sand dunes where the troops sought shelter. Additionally, their U-boats and motor launches targeted the shipping traffic. The British and French Armies faced intense struggle as they fought within an ever-narrowing and ever-contracting area.",

Otherwise all would have been cut off,\nand all would have shared the fate to which King Leopold had condemned the\nfinest Army his country had ever formed. So in doing this and in exposing this\nflank, as anyone who followed the operations on the map will see, contact was\nlost between the British and two out of the three corps forming the First\nFrench Army, who were still farther from the coast than we were, and it seemed\nimpossible that any large number of Allied troops could reach the coast.\n\nThe enemy attacked on all sides with great strength and fierceness, and\ntheir main power, the power of their far more numerous Air Force, was thrown\ninto the battle or else concentrated upon Dunkirk and the beaches. Pressing in\nupon the narrow exit, both from the east and from the west, the enemy began to\nfire with cannon upon the beaches by which alone the shipping could approach or\ndepart. They sowed magnetic mines in the channels and seas; they sent repeated\nwaves of hostile aircraft, sometimes more than a hundred strong in one\nformation, to cast their bombs upon the single pier that remained, and upon the\nsand dunes upon which the troops had their eyes for shelter. Their U-boats, one\nof which was sunk, and their motor launches took their toll of the vast traffic\nwhich now began. For four or five days an intense struggle reigned. All their\narmored divisions-or what Was left of them-together with great masses of\ninfantry and artillery, hurled themselves in vain upon the ever-narrowing,\never-contracting appendix within which the British and French Armies\nfought."

A miracle of deliverance, achieved by valor, by perseverance, by perfect\ndiscipline, by faultless service, by resource, by skill, by unconquerable\nfidelity, is manifest to us all. The enemy was hurled back by the retreating\nBritish and French troops. He was so roughly handled that he did not hurry\ntheir departure seriously.

We must be very careful not to\nassign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by\nevacuations. But there was a victory inside this deliverance, which should be\nnoted. It was gained by the Air Force. Many of our soldiers coming back have\nnot seen the Air Force at work; they saw only the bombers which escaped its\nprotective attack. They underrate its achievements.

They will never surrender, and if the Island were subjugated, the Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would continue the struggle until the New World steps forth to rescue and liberate the old.",

At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve\nof His Majesty\u2019s Government-every man of them. That is the will of Parliament\nand the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in\ntheir cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil,\naiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. Even\nthough large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may\nfall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we\nshall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we\nshall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and\ngrowing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may\nbe, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing\ngrounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the\nhills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment\nbelieve, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then\nour Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry\non the struggle, until, in God\u2019s good time, the New World, with all its power\nand might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old."
