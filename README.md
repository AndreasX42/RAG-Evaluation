RAGflow provides tools for constructing and evaluating Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, empowering developers to craft efficient question-answer applications leveraging LLMs.

# üìã TODO
- Write unit and integration tests for CI
- Implement better Login/Authentication in Streamlit app
- Set up CD onto Cloud environment (Kubernetes)
- Optimize some design choices (shared volumes should be some cloud storage)
    
# üåü Key Features & Functionalities
- `Document Store Integration` Provide documents in formats like pdf and docx as knowledge base.
- `Dynamic Parameter Selection` Customize parameters such as document splitting strategies, embedding model, and question-answering LLMs for evaluations.
- `Automated Dataset Generation` Automatically generates question answer pairs from the provided documents as evaluation dataset to evaluate each parameterized RAG system.
- `Evaluation & Optimization` Optimize performance using grid searches across parameter spaces.
- `Advanced Retrieval Mechanisms` Employ techniques like "MMR" and the SelfQueryRetriever for optimal data extraction.
- `Integration with External Platforms` Collaborate with platforms like Anyscale, MosaicML, and Replicate for enhanced functionalities and state-of-the-art LLM models.
- `Interactive Feedback Loop` Refine and improve your RAG system with interactive feedback based on real-world results.
    
# üöÄ Workflow
- Automatic Generation of Question-Answer Pairs\
Begin with RAGflow's capability to generate relevant question-answer pairs from provided documents.
Hyperparameter Evaluation
- Evaluate provided hyperparameters \
After generating Q&A pairs, dive deep into hyperparameter evaluation. Provide your hyperparameters, let RAGflow evaluate their efficacy, and obtain insights for crafting robust RAG systems.
