# RAG-Evaluation 👨‍💻

This repository offers tools to construct and evaluate Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for creating question-answer applications on top of document stores. We treat parameters such as chunk size, overlap, the choice of embedding model and the chat model as hyperparameters. A grid search is performed in this parameter space to optimize results.

The rough workflow of building and evaluating these systems is shown here:
